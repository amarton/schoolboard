Allegany County,Tammy Fraley,y,null,facebook.com/citizensfortammyfraley,tammyfraleyboe@gmail.com,52,"cBEYONData, LLC. - Senior Systems Integration Specialist","Bachelor of business administration, accounting, Texas A&M of Commerce 1993 (formerly East Texas State University)","<p>I initially ran for the board as I wanted to be a part of making the educational system in Allegany County strong and impact the growing need to increase workforce development to keep the younger generation in our county upon graduation. Having served for almost eight years, I have found that my passion remains the same with only a slight variation. I want to help provide a well-rounded education and social upbringing of our youngest citizens so that they can be proud of where they came from and strive to give back to their community.","<p>I have served as a local school board member in Allegany County for the past eight years. During this timeframe, I also served as a member of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education, including as board president. I started my path in local boards because of the lack of parental input in my own children's education. I was frustrated with the lack of synergy across the state on the availability of resources.  
<p>Now with the Blueprint for Maryland's future coming to fruition, the opportunity is ripe for ALL to be part of the process that can change education across our entire county. 
<p>I have served in family engagement groups at my student's elementary and middle schools. I also serve within several local organizations, including the Salvation Army Advisory Board, LaVale Athletic Association, and was most recently appointed to the Allegany County Citizens Review Board for Children by Gov. Wes Moore. 
<p>I believe I am the best candidate for our area because of my willingness to engage at all levels. I believe there needs to be a voice for the parents of current students as well as future students. There also needs to be a voice of those ""in the trenches"" to include local business owners, community members, advocates for change, etc.","<p>In my opinion, the most important issue facing Allegany County school board is the employee morale and student/employee mental health support. There is a wealth of opportunity being provided at the state level to include grant funding and cooperation for the national center for student mental health that must be utilized by our county. We need to not feed into the stigma that if you ignore the issue, it will not exist. 
<p>I plan to continue to push for inclusion of the student voice in decisions as well as utilization of programs and practices outside of our current system. We must not assume that it will ""correct itself.""","<p>I truly admire Adrienne Alease Jones as the first woman to serve as the speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates. As I have delved further into the political world in Allegany County, I found that very few strong woman leaders emerged. When I started to attend conferences I found that a strong leader does not depend on their gender but on their ability to gather people to make a difference. Ms. Jones inspires me to keep pushing forward and not allow the nay-sayers to hold me back.
","<p>The blueprint initiative to hire additional educators across the state to provide more individualized attention to students sounds great in theory, but the practicality of it is that there is a VERY limited pool of educators within the state of Maryland. In Allegany County, we struggle to have educators apply for positions due to the climate of employee morale along with the limited flexibility to adjust to various teaching styles. As a board member, I will continue to advocate for the educators to have a seat at the table with board members to ensure all concerns are voiced and addressed where possible. 
<p> I personally would like to see a stronger focus on the recruitment of support personnel to provide more to our students. The utilization of coordinated community supports will be critical to the success of our educational system in Allegany County.","<p>I personally believe that student use of cellphones during the school day should be restricted, as it is only a distraction for the students. They utilize the phone for cheating in class. Also, I have seen several problems in school start with a post on social media or through bullying a student while it is filmed by another. As a school board member I would seek input from educators as to what they feel works best in a majority of situations, as they are the ones on the battlefield.","<p>School safety within our county not only involves the physical aspects of the buildings but also the community surrounding them. I believe we must continue to pursue memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with local law enforcement agencies to have dedicated law enforcement officers assigned to specific schools. Additionally, there needs to be some coordinated support provided across all prevailing needs of not only the student body but that of the staff and administration.","<p>My position is that there should not be the absolute banning of books; however, there should be a policy on the age-appropriateness. There should always be alternatives for students whose parents/guardians request an opt-out of certain books. Our nation was built on the freedoms afforded to us, and therefore the public education system must provide opportunities for all voices to be heard.
",I believe that a students' parents/guardians should be part of any decision made regarding their student.  The school system is there to support general education of students and to prepare them for the outside world. There should be no policies in place that take away the parents/guardians right to be part of the process.
Allegany County,Max Green,y,null,facebook.com/MaxGreenforAlleganyCountyBoardofEducation, magreen.01@gmail.com,33,"Senior technology representative, U.S. Senate sergeant at arms","Master's degree in public management, Johns Hopkins University","<p>I am running for the Allegany County Board of Education because I believe in the power of public education to transform lives, and I want to ensure that every student in our county has access to the best possible education. As a parent and the husband of a public-school teacher, I have a personal stake in the future of our schools. I’ve seen firsthand the challenges facing our educators, from classroom management issues to a lack of support for students who need it most.
<p>I’m committed to addressing these challenges by advocating for clear, consistent discipline policies, improving parent and community engagement, and fostering transparency and accountability in school board decisions. My professional experience in public management and my role as a community leader have given me the skills to approach these issues with a solutions-focused mindset.
<p>I’m running because I believe we need new voices and fresh ideas on the Board of Education—voices that will prioritize students, listen to teachers, and work tirelessly to improve our schools.
<p>I'm also running because I know how frustrated parents and teachers are with the current Board of Education. Our current elected board is not prepared for the realities of Blueprint implementation. I'm running because I want to ensure that we have the right person for the job who can make sound, transparent decisions about this implementation based on feedback from all stakeholders. 
<p>Finally, my experience growing up in rural Allegany County is similar to many others. I was primarily raised by my grandmother, who worked full time until her death to provide for my siblings and me. I had to get a job at the age of 14, which I had to balance with school and extracurricular activities, to help make ends meet. We did not have much, and I felt like I would never make it out of the cycle of generational poverty. My saving grace was teachers and community members who stepped up to help me navigate the transition out of school—helping me to apply for student aid and to college as a first-generation college student. I owe so much to them, and one of the most effective ways to pay it forward is by looking out for the next generation of our community. ","<p>I am running for the Allegany County Board of Education as a lifelong community organizer, a dedicated public servant, and an advocate for students, teachers and families. I bring over a decade in public sector project management and leadership experience, an understanding of the complex issues facing students and families as a former community mental health services provider and a deep passion for making the world a better place. My master’s degree in public management and data analytics from Johns Hopkins University has prepared me to approach educational challenges with a focus on data-driven solutions and accountability.
<p>As the husband of a public-school teacher and the father of two young children, I understand the importance of ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education in a safe, supportive environment. I have firsthand experience advocating for our community, having founded the West Side Neighborhood Association and serving on the Local Advisory Council for Career and Technical Education.
<p>My platform centers on three core priorities: improving classroom management and discipline policies, increasing parent and community engagement, and ensuring transparency and accountability in decision-making. I will work to strengthen our schools by fostering meaningful discourse, creating clear policies that support teachers and students, and ensuring that the board remains accessible and responsive to the needs of the community.
<p>With my diverse experience and strong commitment to public service, I am ready to bring a fresh perspective and a focus on solutions to the Board of Education. Together, we can build stronger schools and a brighter future for all students.","While I am tempted to argue that the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is the most important long-term issue, there is a crisis in discipline and classroom management that is making it difficult to achieve the primary mission of our school system: ensuring all students' right to a high-quality education in a safe and productive learning environment. It also undermines efforts to recruit and retain high-quality educators. ","I have always admired Franklin Delano Roosevelt for leading our nation through one of its most challenging periods since the Civil War. Domestically, he tackled the Great Depression with the New Deal—arguably one of the most influential policy sets in American history. The New Deal provided a social safety net, labor protections and critical banking regulations, while also enabling rural electrification and building infrastructure that shaped modern America. Beyond his domestic achievements, Roosevelt played a pivotal role in guiding the U.S. through the global crisis of World War II. He ended isolationism, supported the Allies, and mobilized the U.S. war effort after Pearl Harbor. His leadership, along with his advisors and the sacrifices of American servicemembers, made victory possible. Roosevelt’s vision and resilience continue to inspire me as a model of leadership in the face of unprecedented challenges and remind me that we've weathered greater existential threats to our nation, democracy, and justice.","<p>The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is a transformative plan for public education, addressing critical needs such as early childhood education, increased teacher pay and expanded support for underserved families. For Allegany County, this initiative is a much-needed boost, as it provides the resources to address long-standing challenges, particularly in schools serving low-income, rural families. However, for the Blueprint to succeed, the focus must be on how these funds are used at the local level.
<p>Increased teacher pay and support services are crucial for attracting and retaining quality educators, but we must ensure that this funding reaches classrooms and benefits teachers directly. Professional development, classroom management tools, and support staff should be prioritized to create a more stable learning environment. Additionally, the Blueprint's focus on career and technical education offers significant potential for Allegany County, especially in preparing students for jobs in skilled trades.
<p>Effective implementation of the Blueprint requires strong community engagement. Parents, teachers, and local leaders must be involved in decisions about how resources are allocated and used. If elected, I will advocate for transparency and accountability to ensure that these historic investments lead to real, measurable improvements for students and educators. My goal is to ensure that Allegany County not only benefits from the increased funding but also builds sustainable, long-term improvements to the quality of education and opportunities for all students. I also believe that this requires transparent and thoughtful consideration of the implementation plan, ensuring we do not misrepresent the areas of need in our community and school system. 
<p>This is a pivotal moment for Maryland’s schools, and we must get it right.","Cellphone policies remain one of the most difficult areas for school systems to address. While there’s some agreement among students, parents, teachers, and administrators, key issues—like maintaining communication during emergencies—continue to create divides. Our current policy, which leaves phone use up to teacher discretion, is inconsistent and places too much burden on teachers without adequate support from school leadership or the Board of Education. I believe phones should be allowed during lunch, study hall and advisory periods for older students, but not in classrooms, bathrooms or locker rooms. However, enforcement is nearly impossible under current practices. We need a clear, districtwide policy, backed by data and modeled after successful approaches in other areas. This policy should prioritize minimizing disruptions, bullying and harassment while balancing the need for safety and acknowledging the realities of our highly-connected world. Continuous review and adjustment will be necessary as we gather feedback.","No, I am not satisfied with our school district’s efforts to ensure student safety. I believe the system is failing our students, and I fear more serious acts of violence will occur if changes aren’t made. We currently lack metal detectors, and teachers and administrators are often discouraged—or outright unable—to refer students for disciplinary actions. Discipline and safety concerns are inconsistently handled, creating a dangerous environment. I've spoken with many teachers and parents who have reported incidents of weapons, like knives, being brought to school, yet the students responsible often face no real consequences or referrals. We must reevaluate discipline policies, encourage teachers to report all incidents of violence or threats, and ensure public input to improve safety measures. Additionally, online bullying continues unchecked, and schools need better ways to address these issues. Our focus must be on creating consistent, transparent policies to protect every student.","Books should not be banned or removed from school libraries. Instead, if there are concerns about a lack of diverse perspectives, I encourage adding more books, not restricting access. Exposure to a wide range of ideas is crucial for developing critical thinking, emotional intelligence,\ and the skills necessary for a healthy democracy. Limiting access to books or discouraging literacy harms students. Research consistently shows that access to books directly correlates with higher reading scores, and for many children—especially those from low-income families—school libraries are their primary source of reading materials. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 61% of low-income families have no books in the home, making school libraries essential. Our children need more books, more ideas and more opportunities to read—not fewer.","No law restricts parents from discussing gender identity or preferred pronouns with their children. It's unreasonable to expect teachers to monitor such private conversations, and it is not their role to inform parents about a student’s pronoun preferences unless legally required. Every student deserves to feel safe and supported in school, regardless of their identity. Using preferred pronouns fosters an inclusive environment and allows students to feel accepted. Importantly, this practice causes no harm to others—it simply reflects respect for the individual. Schools should prioritize creating an environment where all students feel valued, ensuring their personal choices are respected as long as they do not negatively impact others. In the absence of court rulings or specific legislation, it’s essential to protect the privacy and dignity of all students while maintaining the focus on their well-being and education."

","For years I've noticed the preparedness of our incoming students declining, and I wanted to ensure that schools better prepared their students for college or the real world, a world with greater diversity and opportunity than we might find currently in Allegany County. More importantly, we need to understand that schools have a greater role in the community and in student lives than just education—from ensuring that students are fed so they can perform, to working to support their emotional and psychological well-being, schools are doing more than ever to take care of our children. More importantly, the current climate in public education begs for an objective and educated board to help guide the district through stormy weather. As a lifelong learner, and as someone who has worked with students from ages 6 to 66, I believe that my experience and my clear vision give me the capacity to help our students and our schools.","School board candidates should, first and foremost, value education with a focus on the broad needs of the students, and unfortunately, many people run for school board with an agenda regarding their children. A school board member needs to advocate for the role of the schools in the community—and value all the players in the schools, from students and teachers to coaches, support staff and administrators. A good candidate understands that each school in the district has a culture, and the board's job is to help sustain and engage that culture, while also helping shape it toward the broader community culture and maintaining educational standards. As a very public member of the community, I will be an advocate for our teachers, our students, and our schools.","Cellphones in the classroom and the impact of social media on our students is the biggest problem we have. Besides being a distraction, the dopamine hit of responding to notifications can have an addictive effect on our students. This can lead to educational and disciplinary issues. Then there's the issue of cyberbullying and other technology-related problems that can go with the use of phones.",Jimmy Carter. His work as both a political leader and as a social leader with Habitat for Humanity demonstrate his willingness to serve for the greater good.,"<p>The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is a great start to help promote faculty creativity and lessen the significance of standardized tests, which often only measure short-term retention and a student's capacity to take tests. Furthermore, moves to bring in more teachers, lower class sizes and help create more robust learning environments for students are all laudable.
Furthermore, although some might see the Blueprint as an unfunded mandate or meddling from Annapolis elites, the Blueprint provides a clear vision for Maryland students as a group. We live in a rapidly changing world, and the Blueprint provides a shared vision to help make sure our students are prepared for the world they'll enter.
<p>The failures of the Blueprint have to do with funding, particularly in a region like Allegany County, which is one of the poorest counties in the state. The school board will have to navigate the budget and community concerns. Having a board that advocates for the Blueprint is key. More importantly, though, the Board has to recognize that the Blueprint will need to adapt to on-the-ground changes.","I think cellphone usage is one of the biggest problems facing our students, and while they provide a means to protect students in case something goes wrong in the school, more often than not, cellphones work as an in-class distraction, provide a means for bullying students and others, and provide a means for academic dishonesty.","In general I think Allegany schools are fairly safe. I loathe the idea of making our schools seem like they're under attack because that provides an atmosphere ripe for distraction. I also worry about the use of police in the schools, which can often lead to escalation of problems rather than mediated solutions. One of the most valuable things schools can teach us is how to interact with others with mutual respect and dignity. This includes interaction among the student body but also between students and faculty, staff and administration.","<p>I don't believe in censorship or book banning. I know this as a literature teacher, most of our students aren't randomly checking books out of school or classroom libraries, which means that the books students choose to read provide validation or respect.
<p>Books teach us how to live in a diverse society. They teach us how to survive heartache, loss and cruelty. They teach us empathy. They teach us how to talk to one another, and the consequences of our actions. Yes, books can make us sad. Yes, books can teach kids about the cruelties of the world. They can cover subjects that might make certain parents uncomfortable, but that's where fostering a dialogue between parents and children comes in. There are books, no doubt, my mother wishes I hadn't read at age 15, but I can guarantee you, I'm glad I did because they prepared me for the world I entered.","Kids have it hard enough. Kids who feel body dysmorphia and have questions about their identity and sex have it so much harder. It's a fact. I've watched several of my college students struggle. A teacher's goal should always be to provide ways for students to succeed, and one way to do that is to remove whatever small sources of pain they might feel. If referring to a student by a different pronoun makes them feel seen, supported, and respected, and if that then enables them to work well, why wouldn't a teacher—or anyone—want to do that?"

","I taught for 49 years for the kids! I ran for the school board in 2020 for the kids! I believe I have served them well during my first term because of my knowledge of the educational system in Anne Arundel County as well as what is essential for our students to belong, grow and succeed! I am running for a second term for the kids! We have more work to do to go from a good school system to a great school system.",I am a 49-year teacher who stays focused on improving student outcomes. The only politics you will hear from me is the politics of kids! ,"<p>There are many. We know that the mental health of our students and staff is our number one issue. In Anne Arundel County Public Schools, we are focused on providing help and mentors to our students and staff. The building of relationships is the heart of teaching in the world today. Everyone at all levels must build solid relationships with our students based on caring, trust and respect. 
<p>We must also meet the mandates of the Maryland Blueprint, the law! In Anne Arundel County Public Schools, we are well on our way to doing just that! ","I admire Steuart Pittman, our county executive in Anne Arundel County because of his steadfast support for our schools, students and families. In order to meet the mandates of the Maryland Blueprint, we need public leaders who believe that the future of our county, state, and nation lies within the walls of our schools, where our great students are doing great things and are preparing themselves for the future ahead. ","The Blueprint has already impacted our district. It is not perfect. It does have some flaws. However, the premise is sound. Resources must be provided where the needs exist. All students deserve the chance to receive the best possible education to prepare them to be citizens in an ever-changing technological society. There is a mandate for a minimum starting salary for teachers, which we are meeting thanks to the help and support of our political friends. There is a mandate for a new career ladder, which we have already developed, which is becoming a model for other districts. There is a mandate for highly qualified teachers, and we are well on our way to meeting that mandate. We will continue to do our best to meet the requirements of the Maryland Blueprint.  ","We have developed new electronic device guidelines for 2024-2025, and it is our expectation that the guidelines be respected and followed by students, parents, and staff. We are looking at our policies to develop appropriate policies and regulations to make sure that students are focused in their classes on learning. ","I am satisfied. We are focused on student and staff health and safety as a number one priority, and we will continue that focus. The best way to guarantee safety is to provide help and support to stakeholders in need.  ","In Anne Arundel County Public Schools, we have a policy and a process to deal with individual cases. I have been a part of that process as an educator. I served as the chair of a committee created to deal with a parent concern about a specific book at North County High School in 2011. A committee of students, teachers, parents and community stakeholders participated and provided a recommendation to the board of education, which was accepted. The process does work. ","It is not my job to tell students who they are. It is not my job to parent students. It is my job to see that every student has the best chance for a great education. Communication and collaboration are the keys to successful relationship building so that our kids can all belong, grow and succeed! "
Anne Arundel County District 3,Erica McFarland,y,ericamcfarland.com,facebook.com/friendsofericamcfarland,friendsofericamcfarland@gmail.com,45,"Our Lady of the Fields Church, office manager",I began college for elementary education before getting married and starting a family.,"I am running because I feel I can make a difference in our schools and our community. I am thoughtful in listening to concerns, engaging in conversation and in collaboratively coming up with creative and effective solutions when issues arise. I can see the good in every person, but I also see some division and misunderstanding of each other. I’d like to be the bridge that brings us together. I truly believe that, simply put, we all just want what’s best for our children. Let’s work together with open hearts and minds for our students. I know that given the necessary education and tools, our kids can make the world a better place. I want to support that. I want to be a part of that. Helping our children to rise to challenges, come up with creative solutions and watching them soar would make me so proud.","I work well with others, even when there are disagreements. I have the ability to remain calm and respectful of others and aim to always come to a greater understanding of different points of view and how we can work together. I firmly believe that each person has something to lend to a collaborative group. What I can lend is my heart. This may sound impractical, as there are so many practical and intellectual decisions to be made by the board. But what I have found is that when I lead with my heart, the rest comes easily. In every decision, I will be thinking about the people it affects- who it will benefit and if it will leave anyone behind. I carry the heart of a teacher and the love of a parent.","Currently, the greatest need is staffing. We need to have enough mental health professionals, special education educators, nurses, food service workers, bus drivers, and all other positions that are critical to the needs in our schools. In order to do this, we need to offer competitive pay in today’s market and foster a positive work environment where our staff feels valued. Investment in our staff is returned to us in full in their investment in the future of our children and our community.","I admire Pope Francis. Even being pope, he is still human and imperfect, but he has a good heart. He has challenged the way we think about people and the world around us. He encourages us to serve our neighbor, to be kind to those around us, to be accepting of all people, and to love above all else.","The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future keeps at its heart that the education of our children is paramount to our future. It prioritizes education, beginning with our youngest learners, and works to ensure equity, readiness for the next steps along the way, and aims to attract and retain a diverse set of quality educators. Of course, even with the best thought-out plan, oversight is required to make sure that it is being implemented in a way that produces the desired result. As the Blueprint rolls out, especially when there are so many needs in our schools vying for funding, we will need to be mindful to think creatively, course-correct as needed, and put in a lot of hard work. But I firmly believe that all of our effort will pay off as we see our students succeed","New guidelines were provided at Anne Arundel County Public Schools this year by Superintendent Dr. Mark Bedell, which prohibit cellphone use in elementary and middle schools, while allowing high schoolers to have them out only in the cafeteria at lunchtime. In listening to both teachers and students, I think that cellphones have become too large a distraction in our classrooms, and they should be away during instruction. In listening to parents, many feel that they want their student’s cellphone accessible at all times in case of emergency. I absolutely understand this concern. The current guidelines allow for both of these. The guidelines should be enforced across the board, with support from the administration and consistent consequences.","Everyone should feel safe in our schools. Unfortunately, bullying continues to be a problem. We really need to focus on social-emotional learning and fostering a culture of acceptance of others from the youngest grades and up. It breaks my heart that some people are made to feel like they don’t belong in our schools and community just for being who they are. This is near and dear to my heart, and I will always stand up for those who are pushed to the margins.","There is a process in place to review books before they are put on the shelves and to request a review of books already in the library. I trust our educators and librarians to choose a wide range of age-level books that reflect the diversity of our student population. Reading instills a love for learning, develops a creative imagination, challenges our mindset, supports us through tough times and teaches us about the world around us. We are all unique in what speaks to us, and we have the choice to read a book or leave it on the shelf, but we need to maintain diversity in book choices so that we all have access to the books that spark our interest.","As a parent, no matter which pronouns feel right to my children, I will love them. With that, it breaks my heart that there are kids out there who don't feel comfortable sharing things like this with the people in their home. I would encourage all parents to remind their kids often that they will be loved and cared for no matter what. Unfortunately, there are still situations where a child faces being kicked out of their home or ostracized for coming out to their family. Our duty as a school system is to support the child. I wish we could have a world where this is not something we have to choose, but in the present situation, I do not think the school system should be forced to have a child come out to their parents if they are not yet comfortable doing so."

go from one of the top systems in the state to mediocre at best. I saw the test scores that are atrocious to say the least. I decided the best way to invoke change was not to sit on the outside and complain but to take my experience and put it to use on the board. 
","Thirty-six years in public education. I have a 35,000-foot view of our system and its needs. Having been in the classroom, serving on the business side of the system and back to instruction, I know where the deficiencies are and how to correct them.","Poor test scores are the most important issue, followed very closely by a lack of discipline. It’s time to get back to the fundamentals of learning and regain control of the classroom.","Any individual who, at their community level, stands up for the betterment of the people with whom they live and serve. ","The Blueprint is a multi-billion dollar boondoggle that will provide zero results in student performance, much like the “all-day kindergarten” program of years ago. It is a financial burden, an unfunded mandate, that is already undergoing scrutiny due to its burdensome debt and unrealistic expectations. ","I agree with our superintendent’s policy on cellphone use. They should not be seen outside of lunch periods. The ONLY exception, considering our teachers do not have enough technology in the classrooms, would be for research of a topic of discussion at that moment. ","Anne Arundel County Public Schools  have worked hard to ensure safety. But as with all lapses, it’s not necessarily the facility but human error. Every individual in a school must be honed in on anything unusual that could lead to catastrophic events. ","Books that are age- inappropriate with graphic sexual content and illustrations should be removed. A decision should be made by a committee consisting of school staff, parents and the mental health community. ","Students should be referred to by the name in the teacher's roster/gradebook. Parents, having the ultimate responsibility both legally and financially for their students, should absolutely be informed about anything going on with their students in the system. "

I am the assistant commissioner of occupational and professional licensing.,"I received my bachelor's degree in government and politics from the University of Maryland, College Park.
","I am running for the Board of Education because now is the time to advocate for and implement changes that will have the most positive impacts for our educators, students and their families. With the promise of Blueprint programming underway, our schools have everything to gain — but only if these resources are distributed in ways that increase equity and the odds of success for our students.","As a mother to two children who attend schools within the Arundel cluster, I am deeply committed to the academic success and personal growth of our students. As a public servant with experience in program implementation, budget management, legislative coordination, personnel management and constituent services, I will bring a unique perspective to the board that emphasizes oversight and accountability.","The recruiting and retention of educators and service providers is not only the most important issue facing our school board, it is a national crisis affecting school systems throughout the United States. Our veteran educators are exhausted and have been overextending themselves for too long, but many of our newest teachers are electing to leave the classroom and move on to careers that pay more and provide a better life-work balance. If elected, I will continue to ensure constant evaluations of Anne Arundel County’s competitiveness with surrounding counties and push for higher salaries for our educators and staff.","I greatly admire Joseline Peña-Melnyk, delegate for District 21, which incorporates Anne Arundel and Prince George’s counties. Although she displays tremendous tenacity and grit when fighting for strong policies that benefit women, immigrants and other marginalized communities, she also deeply believes in mentorship and creating opportunities to connect with the next generation of community leaders. ","The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future has the potential to be the investment that public schools need in our state if it is implemented properly. All of the pillars presented are imperative to the success of our school system and must be rated a top priority for Anne Arundel County Public Schools. With the measured rollout of Blueprint funding, the amount of educational and career readiness resources available for students will increase, early childhood education will become more accessible, and the school system will continue to focus on recruiting and retaining diverse, high quality educators. However, with increased resources comes the increased need for oversight, accountability and feedback. As a board member, I will advocate for the proper implementation and the resources necessary to make the Blueprint work for Anne Arundel County Public Schools. 
","The goal of the policy should be to reduce the amount of student distraction teachers are dealing with during instructional periods. Dr. Mark Bedell has commented that “we only have our students in school for about 19 percent of each week, and we need to maximize every minute of instruction that we can.” I agree with him and believe not only will our students be focused more on what happens in the classroom if they are not allowed to have their phones out, but that their mental health will be improved by significantly increasing the amount of human interaction between them and the other students. I would like to see a planned layout of progressive steps where students are given a warning and then moved to confiscation, with a parent or guardian having to pick up the phone from the school. Buy-in from parents and caretakers is critical for any policy to be successful. ","<p>I will continue to emphasize building supportive school communities by allocating resources to enable schools to sponsor more events and clubs that give students and teachers the opportunity to be involved and build a deeper connection with their schools and each other. Students that have positive relationships with others and staff through in-class and extracurricular activities feel a sense of ownership, pride, and connection that make them one of our first lines of defense in curbing bullying and preventing violence in the school setting.
<p>Additionally, I will advocate for an increase in mental health and counseling resources for students and staff. Increasing the number of counselors and psychologists per school is critical to assisting students with emotional learning while navigating challenging situations.
<p>To enhance emergency response protocols, I would encourage a deeper partnership between law enforcement and schools that extends to on-site training of emergency response procedures, even to the extent of simulating responses during professional development training days so all staff are trained and prepared to handle emergency situations. ","I will vote against book bans and the editing of curriculum based on personal beliefs. No topic should be banned from curriculum or libraries, provided that they are age appropriate, and I really trust our librarians and educators to determine that for their students. When we don’t provide opportunities for our children to learn about people who are different from them, they become adults who find it challenging to accept diversity in others.","Preferred names and pronouns should be respected by fellow students, educators and administrators. Also, it is not a school’s role to notify parents of a child's decision to use a name or gender that is different from what is on their birth certificate."

","I am running because I know that I can be a board member who supports and advocates for everyone, not just specific groups or areas that are deemed “easy.” All communities and schools are equally important and deserve the same support by their Board of Education representative. I can remove politics from the table and instead work on real policy that is focused on what needs to be done to ensure educational equity and success. I am the person who will be at the table for the love of others, not the love of myself. People are my passion, and I want to fight to make things better and advocate for what’s right. ","I have been an advocate for students, parents and educators since 2005. I have five children currently attending or graduated from Anne Arundel County Public Schools, and I have seen what works and what does not. In my role as president for the parent teacher groups at the elementary, middle and high school levels, I have been at the forefront fighting for or against school start times changes, redistricting, educator salaries, building improvements, transportation issues and special education resources to ensure all in our district have what they need to be successful in Anne Arundel County Public Schools.  When my first child entered Anne Arundel County Public Schools 20 years ago, I immediately became involved in the classrooms and the school's parent organization. I know firsthand what parents need to be able to trust and respect educators and Anne Arundel County Public Schools, what teachers need to feel supported and valued, and what children need to be successful in the classroom and in Anne Arundel County Public Schools. When elected, I will continue to do as I have always done on a larger scale- engage with parents to help support initiatives, advocate for educators to get what they need in and out of the classroom, and ensure all children have the same opportunities to succeed in a safe environment.","I believe staffing is the main concern for parents and educators. Parents want smaller class sizes, counselors who have manageable caseloads, appropriate special education staffing so that students receive all the services they need and mental health supports for all students. Educators want adequate planning time, smaller classes and time to truly develop relationships with students. We must attract more staffing to meet the concerns of parents, and we must use that additional staffing to ease the burdens on our existing staff. And this all leads back to funding—funding for more staff to fill gaps and funding to competitively compensate and retain the staff we currently have. Having relationships with current county officials will help me to ensure the Blueprint protocols on salaries for new and existing educators can be funded. ","“You must be the change you want to see in the world” is a quote I live by, attributed to Gandhi. We cannot wait for the change we want to occur; we must make it happen ourselves. Talking about things does not bring change—action does! Gandhi was not just a great communicator, he also had compassion, empathy, and integrity and advocated for the marginalized. Most importantly, he led by example. These are the qualities that make a great leader, and I embrace these traits in my leadership roles to ensure I’m inspiring others — not just to talk about doing better, but taking action to do better for others.
","The Blueprint is an aspirational plan to dramatically change and improve our schools. Our district and our students will benefit greatly from the increased investment, especially for early childhood education and career and technology programs. The increased salaries for teacher retention and recruitment are so important to ensure that we can attract the most professional staff across all areas. The expansion of  pre-kindergarten and 3-year-old classrooms is crucial to bringing our children to school ready to learn. The community schools' program is making a significant difference in parent engagement and family support services in many of our most in-need communities. However, to reach all these goals, we must have the funding. As a board member, I will be tasked with crafting a budget to meet these goals and then working with our county elected officials to ensure the funding is allocated. I have long-standing relationships and support of numerous county and state officials that will be instrumental in securing the necessary funding. Along with funding, as a board member I will have a primary responsibility to ensure Policy Area 5: Accountability in the Blueprint is followed, ensuring that the guidelines are being properly implemented. Data collection will be vital to ensuring that we are executing the pillars with success. The board must be regularly apprised of progress and insist that changes be made where we are falling short.  I am prepared to fully exercise oversight of the superintendent to ensure that the promise of the Blueprint is met.","The goal is for students to be more focused academically and to remove the burden of policing cellphones from our educators. This is a battle that is fought constantly, especially at our middle and high schools, and these new rules are a must. I would like to see a well-defined tiered process for infractions and consequences at each school level, just as we have other areas of misconduct in the Student Code of Conduct. I also believe we need to have continuous parent education as well; I foresee some of the biggest pushback coming from parents. The key to success of the policy will be consistency in enforcement at all school levels.","I do believe Anne Arundel County Public Schools prioritizes student safety, but this is an area that must be continuously reviewed and must have ongoing education for students, staff and families. For instance, I am a big supporter of Anne Arundel County Police student resource officers in our high schools and some middle schools. The relationships these officers build with students and the added security presence is invaluable. However, many parents, particularly parents of children of color, have legitimate concerns about possible profiling of their students and the risk of being pulled into the criminal justice system. The school system and the police department must ensure and regularly communicate with families the training and performance standards for all student resource officers. Education, transparency and relationships are key to ensuring that families trust that all parties are focused on the safety and well-being of students.","I am against banning books. Knowledge is power, and we should not restrict that on any level. Public school is where various amounts of people come to learn and thrive together, and decisions are made to serve the entire school community — not the particular interests or beliefs of specific groups. Anne Arundel County Public Schools have a detailed process for reviewing all materials for age-appropriateness. These decisions are made by well-qualified educators, parents and community members. I trust the process.","I do support this. We wish that all children have supportive and understanding families when it comes to their life choices, but sadly, this is not always the case. Whether it's religion, upbringing or ignorance, many still feel that identifying oneself as anything other than what is stated on a birth certificate is wrong; these are not individuals who support their child’s need to freely express who they are and who they want to be. We need to provide a safe space for these kids — let children identify themselves, and let them be proud of who they are without judgment or fear of having retaliation at home."
Anne Arundel County District 5,Dana Schallheim,y,null,facebook.com/danaboed5,danaforboe@hotmail.com,48,"Incumbent Board of Education of Anne Arundel County Public Schools member, representing District 5.
",Master's of business administration.,"I hope District 5 voters will re-elect me because we are a better school district than when I joined the board six years ago, and we have laid a foundation to become the best in the state; however, the work isn’t done. I have focused on improving four student outcomes: recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers, implementing research-based curriculum, support for mental health, and social-emotional development under the leadership of Dr. Mark Bedell, a nationally recognized superintendent whom my colleagues and I unanimously hired. This hard work is paying off! As noted in an Anne Arundel County Public Schools media release dated Aug. 19, 2024: the average score of Anne Arundel County Public Schools students taking Advanced Placement exams in the 2023-2024 school year, the number of students taking exams, and the percentage of students achieving a score of 3 or higher all rose for the third consecutive year, and Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores have improved for the second consecutive year. Additionally, I continue to ensure the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is implemented with fidelity including the expansion of college and career pathways and full day pre-kindergarten. Lastly, I would like a second term to ensure that distracting culture wars such as banning books don’t take hold in Anne Arundel County Public Schools. My opponent, who has said publicly that increasing pay is not important to retaining teachers, who supports sending our tax dollars to private schools, is supported by an extremist group that wants to ban books, flags and mental healthcare in schools and called LGTBQIA+ students “mentally ill.”","I bring six years of experience serving on the Board of Education of Anne Arundel County with a record of achievements. A public-school parent with an MBA, I served as chair of the board's Budget Committee for three years, during which I greatly enhanced transparency in the budget adoption process. Over the last six years, I successfully increased teacher and staff pay, advocated for dozens of additional educators and mental health professionals, grew the Special Education department, approved funding for several new schools, voted to implement new science-backed reading and math curriculum, and voted to hire our nationally recognized superintendent, Dr. Mark Bedell. My advocacy for arts and music education, college and career pathways, special education, and on behalf of our diverse communities and military families earned several awards over the years including the coveted Fannie Lou Hamer and Alan Hilliard Legum Civil Rights Award. I championed policies protecting students with food allergies as well as LGTBQIA+ students and overhauled the bullying and bias policies, the policy governing special education, to name a few. I will stand in the breach against distracting culture wars including book banning and the whitewashing of curriculum. All of this hard work is paying off. Anne Arundel County Public Schools is now the fourth best in Maryland in terms of new teacher pay. Advanced Placement test scores as well as the number of students sitting for AP exams has dramatically improved, and Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores have improved for the second consecutive year. ","<p>There are many issues facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools, early childhood literacy chief among them. Anne Arundel County Public Schools has made some improvements in early literacy since 2020 with the implementation of universal reading screening and Wilson Foundations reading interventions for K-3. Where Anne Arundel County Public Schools fell flat is in grades reading comprehension for students in grades 3-5. For years, Anne Arundel County Public Schools taught students to read with a “balanced literacy” approach, very little direct phonics instruction and a lot of guessing words based on pictures or context clues. Some kids learned to read well, but others, especially students with disabilities, fell behind.
<p>I have been an advocate for years for adopting new reading curricula that reflect the latest research, and worked hard to recruit a superintendent, Dr. Mark Bedell, who shares this understanding. A new curriculum based on the science of reading is being implemented during the 2024-2025 school year alongside enhanced supports for secondary students who continue to struggle in this area. Expanding access to full day pre-kindergarten and expanding the number of community mentors in our schools will also improve outcomes in this area.
<p>Additionally, many of our kids are struggling with anxiety and depression — far more than were struggling than before the pandemic. I successfully advocated for additional mental health staff for our schools every single year, and I will continue to do so until we meet the recommended ratios for both school counselors and psychologists.","I admire many public leaders, which makes it difficult to name just one. Kamala Harris is driven, persistent and relentlessly serves our country and its people. Kamala has fearlessly pursued breaking glass ceilings and is unapologetic in doing what she feels is right. ","<p>Overall, I support all of the pillars of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future and, if implemented with fidelity, they will serve Anne Arundel County Public Schools students for a generation.
<p>Early childhood education sets students on a trajectory of success as opposed to starting kindergarten already behind. 
<p>High quality and diverse teachers and school leaders are important because employing excellent teachers equals successful students. As is the case with other professions, it’s difficult to become what you can’t see. Our diverse student body deserves diverse educators to inspire and challenge our students. This is also true for our school leadership. 
<p>New college and career pathways are critical to the workforce of tomorrow. Stagnation does our students a massive disservice after graduation. My role as a current board member is to open doors for students. Whether students pursue the trades, serving in the military, tech careers or college, all paths are valid and wonderful choices and students must be exposed to as many options as possible while in Anne Arundel County Public Schools. 
<p>Under the Blueprint, per-pupil funding will now follow the student as opposed to being lumped in the aggregate into the Anne Arundel County Public Schools operating budget. Equity in funding while avoiding merely shifting resources from high to low performing schools will equal improved student outcomes.
<p>The success of the Blueprint is dependent on governance and accountability. The Blueprint has the high price tag that students deserve, but none of it matters unless the funds are being spent by Anne Arundel County Public Schools and other Maryland school systems as directed. 
","I support the new guidelines that heavily restrict, but do not outright ban, cellphones. For elementary and middle school students, phones are not allowed at any time throughout the school day. For high school students, phones are allowed during flex periods and at lunch. The new guidelines also call for progressive discipline measures for students who abuse this policy including confiscation of the student's cellphone, which requires the parent/guardian to retrieve it from the school. We need to trust our students to keep their phones off and out of sight while properly supporting teachers and administrators in consistently implementing this policy.","Student safety remains a chief concern. During my first term, I worked to improve our bullying and bias policies to among the most robust in the state, as well as suggested changes to our Student Code of Conduct, especially specific to bias events. I have also approved safety infrastructure improvements at dozens of schools, supported expansion of school resource officers in our middle schools, supported Unity Day and Second Step curriculum, which focuses on community building and bullying prevention as well as use of restorative practices systemwide. In my six years on the board, I have fought for the hiring of dozens of mental health positions: school counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and pupil personnel workers. My advocacy ensuring our schools are safe and students have the resources they need will continue as well as continuing to support the relationships Anne Arundel County Public Schools maintains with county agencies including Crisis Response.","It is unconscionable that we are having serious conversations about book banning in the United States in 2024. I trust our professional librarians and media specialists to make decisions about what is age-appropriate to be displayed in school libraries consistent with Maryland State Department of Education, which governs Anne Arundel County Public Schools  curriculum, period. If a parent believes a book chosen for a school library is inappropriate, they have the right to tell their child not to check it out, but they do not have the right to deny my child and her peers the ability to check it out. The book bans we’ve seen in Florida, and even locally in Carroll County, must not come to Anne Arundel County.","I support the Anne Arundel County Public Schools policy that requires the inclusion of parents/guardians in this decision in elementary school. For secondary students, the goal is to involve the parents except in circumstances where doing so would endanger the student. "
Anne Arundel County District 5,LaToya Nkongolo,y,latoya4boe.com,www.facebook.com/latoya4boe,latoya4boe@gmail.com,,I am the owner and operator of a mental health clinic located in Glen Burnie.,"I hold a master’s degree in organizational management and leadership from Springfield College, as well as a master’s degree in social work from the University of Maryland, Baltimore.","I was encouraged to run by my county council representative, state delegates, several sitting Board of Education members and community members due to my long history of working with elected officials to address our community's needs. I have a strong reputation in the county as a bridge builder and gap filler. As a leader, I am proactive in decision-making, focusing on addressing issues before they escalate into crises. Unfortunately, my opponent lacks these skills, which has led to disorder on our board and in our community, ultimately affecting our progress. Our district deserves school board leadership that is proactive, level-headed, and attentive to the needs of all organizations and communities, working together to find common ground to meet everyone’s needs.","For nearly two decades, I have been deeply involved in Anne Arundel County, serving children and families from all backgrounds. In addition to my longstanding commitment to the county, I bring a wide range of skills and expertise that are currently lacking in our current board representative. Every program I’ve developed throughout the county has been successful and continues to serve as a vital resource for our community. As an entrepreneur with strong leadership and budgetary skills, combined with my data-driven decision-making, mental health expertise and focus on academic achievement, I am the most qualified and capable person to guide our schools toward success.","Our current board leadership has not prioritized academics, allowing schools to become overly focused on political and social issues. The recent Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results reveal that less than 55% of Anne Arundel County Public Schools students are proficient in reading, and fewer than 30% are proficient in math. Furthermore, science scores have declined statewide. Anne Arundel, once ranked among the top school districts in the state, is now  mediocre at best. In a recent meeting, our superintendent noted that we lack the time and resources to act as both educational institutions and social service agencies. With a $2 billion budget, we’re not seeing a return on our investment. There are only 180 days in a school year, and we cannot afford to waste our students' time or our tax dollars. I am fully committed to improving academic outcomes for all students.","There are many people I could mention, but if I had to name someone who directly impacted my life, it would be Ronald Reagan. I was raised in low-income housing by a single teenage mother, and Reagan’s literacy initiative helped me break the cycle of poverty. He implemented a reading program called “Book It,” which incentivized reading, especially for students from low-income backgrounds. I believe that reading helped me thrive academically, ultimately leading to me becoming the first in my family to graduate from college, pursue a successful career, start a business and raise my family in a wonderful community. Education is only as strong as its support for our most vulnerable students, and I want stories like mine to be the expectation, not the exception.","As a college-level educator, I fully support additional pay for teachers and expanding trade and career opportunities for high school students. My experience managing budgets as both a county employee and entrepreneur will be invaluable in addressing the needs of our staff and students. However, Anne Arundel County residents, especially taxpayers, should be concerned, as the state’s inability to fully fund the Blueprint shifts responsibility to local taxpayers. This could lead to increased taxes and reduced funding for other essential services. While Anne Arundel County is better positioned than some, critical initiatives, such as public-private partnerships for pre-kindergarten (for 4-year-olds), have not yet materialized. This leaves a potential burden on local capital and operational budgets, similar to the costly and lengthy transition of kindergarten to full-day, which took over a decade and millions of dollars. Therefore, additional funding needs and implementation challenges could further strain local resources.","Our superintendent recently implemented a balanced policy that restricts cellphone use during instructional time but allows students access to their phones during designated times during the school day. Cellphones can be significant distractions in the classroom, impacting students’ focus and overall learning. By limiting usage during class, we create a more focused learning environment that supports academic achievement. However, allowing students access to their phones during designated times can provide them with a sense of independence and a way to stay connected with their families. This approach strikes a balance between minimizing distractions in the classroom and respecting students' need for communication and autonomy.","Safety has declined in our school system, and I am not satisfied with my opponent's approach to student safety. Despite claims of prioritizing safety, her actions fall short in addressing the real issues our schools face. My opponent has not engaged meaningfully with parents, educators or law enforcement, opting instead for superficial solutions that fail to address the root causes of safety concerns. To improve safety in our district, we need regular safety audits, increased access to mental health resources and staff training on de-escalation techniques. Only with these proactive measures can we create an environment where students thrive academically and teachers can do their jobs effectively. ","I do not support book banning, as I believe students benefit from exposure to a wide range of age-appropriate ideas and perspectives. If concerns about specific books arise, I would approach these issues thoughtfully and with an open mind, ensuring that we have a balanced and respectful discussion. I believe in engaging parents, teachers and educational experts to review the content in question. I support parents' rights to have a say in what their children are exposed to and believe that schools should collaborate with parents to make informed decisions that prioritize our students' best interests.","My opponent believes that teachers should be the ones ultimately making decisions for the children, but I do not agree with this approach. Parents know their children better than anyone else, and research shows that parental involvement leads to better mental health outcomes. In my 25 years of experience as a mental health provider, I’ve found that nearly all parents genuinely want what’s best for their children. I believe that policies allowing transgender and gender nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns should not compromise parental involvement. Parents bear the primary responsibility for their children's well-being and should be informed about significant decisions affecting their child's identity and mental health. I support fostering a respectful atmosphere for all students, but this must be balanced with open communication and collaboration with parents. As a mother and mental health therapist, I will support policies that promote parental involvement that will ultimately lead to better outcomes for students, as families play a vital role in their children's development and support. Ensuring that parents are part of the conversation is essential for a healthy and constructive educational environment for all."

","I am seeking a second term to ensure the Board of Education remains focused on what I view as the core goal of Anne Arundel County Public Schools: the continuous improvement of student outcomes. This includes improving academic achievement as well as the social and emotional development of each student so they may reach their full potential. Achieving this goal has been my singular focus since first elected in 2020. Reaching this goal requires responsible oversight of the superintendent, competitive compensation for Anne Arundel County Public Schools employees, closing achievement and opportunity gaps, implementing the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future with fidelity, and ensuring leadership continuity. Also I bring to the board leadership and governance experience and skills. Additionally, I have extensive experience as an educator at higher and adult education levels. I have served on and chaired multiple boards and committees, and served over 10 years as chair of accreditation teams that evaluate schools for accreditation.","Attending schools around the world as the child of a U.S. Foreign Service officer, college teaching, school evaluations and serving on many boards give me deep and varied knowledge of day-to-day operations of schools, and strong leadership and governance experience. As a parent of a 2020 graduate of Annapolis High School, having served on the board of the Annapolis High Parent Teacher Student Association for three years as the vice president, I know what it is like to be a parent of a student in the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system. Finally, my record as a member of the Board of Education since 2020 demonstrates that I have been able to collaborate with my fellow board of education members, including across philosophical and political differences, to craft policies and budgets that enable all Anne Arundel County Public Schools students to move forward, regardless of where they begin.","The most important issue facing Anne Arundel County Public Schools is the existence of persistent gaps in opportunity and achievement between different subgroups of students. If Anne Arundel County Public Schools are to meet their stated aim of equity, meeting every student where they are, and moving all students forward in their achievements, then we must close these gaps. Doing this requires continued emphasis on curriculum alignment and data accountability, and attracting and retaining the very best staff and teachers. We must support diversity in hiring to ensure culturally responsive teaching, and staffing and programming supports for both special education and gifted and talented instruction.","As a student and teacher of American political theory, I have always admired President Abraham Lincoln. In particular, I admire him for his keen intellect and intellectual curiosity, his moral strength, his powerful ability to communicate, his willingness to change his views based upon compelling evidence, and his openness to the ideas of those who did not agree with him.","The Blueprint for Maryland's Future presents a unique opportunity to transform public education and truly meet the needs of our students. Top benefits of the plan include providing universal 3- and 4-year-old pre-kindergarten, raising teacher status and compensation to competitive levels aligned with the work and education of educators, providing ample time for educators to collaborate and plan outside the classroom in order to deliver world class instruction in the classrooms, and ensuring career and college readiness upon graduation. Implementation of the plan requires collaborative relationships with bargaining units, creative thinking to locate spaces for pre-K classrooms, partnerships with business and trade unions to ensure availability of internships and certifications, and transparent communications with stakeholders regarding the implications of the requirement that the “money follows the child,” which could result in reallocation of staff between schools depending on the needs of the particular population of each school.","Anne Arundel County Public Schools recently released guidelines requiring that cellphones be put away at all times during the class day in middle and high schools, except for during lunch. I agree with these guidelines because research has demonstrated that cellphones are a distraction from instruction, and students need to be focused on learning if their outcomes are to continue to improve.","I am satisfied that Anne Arundel County Public Schools implement all the most up-to-date and best practices in security measures to ensure that all students and staff are as safe as they can be in our buildings. It remains the case, however, that the school system has no control over external factors that contribute to safety concerns such as the pervasive availability of guns. In addition to supporting strong security structures and protocols for all buildings, sufficient staffing in every building to ensure appropriate class sizes and sufficient counselors, social workers, school psychologists, and literacy teachers assists in promoting security by supporting students' mental health and building critical relationships with adults.","The books that are provided in school libraries should be developmentally appropriate and aligned with curricular requirements as well as with the interests and needs of students. I trust the highly trained media specialists in Anne Arundel County Public Schools to make well informed, considered determinations about which books fit those requirements, and to create extensive collections in each school to meet the academic and other interests of the diverse student body. If there are individual cases where a caregiver of a student is concerned about a particular book that is available in a school library, then Anne Arundel County Public Schools has in place a process whereby the caregiver may request a review of a book they find to be of concern. If the book, upon review through the current process, fails to meet the stated standards for acquisition, then the book should be removed.","If students are to grow and succeed academically, socially and emotionally, they must have a sense of belonging in their school. Essential to that sense of belonging is empowering educators to create classrooms where every single student feels safe and included. Enabling students to determine for themselves how they wish to be addressed and referred to is critical to that safe and inclusive environment, and therefore to student achievement."

","<p>I am running for the Anne Arundel County Board of Education because I believe that every child deserves access to a high-quality education, regardless of their background. I was profoundly shaped by my educational opportunities; education changed my life, and public education played a large role. I want to ensure that every child in our district has a chance to thrive.
<p>As a Marine Corps veteran, a trustee of the Anne Arundel County Public Library, and a senior strategist at a leading education company, I bring a diverse set of experiences and a deep commitment to public service. I understand the value of collaboration, listening to one another, engaging with the community, and considering the personal impact and trade offs every decision can have on our students and families. I believe we can address the challenges facing our schools by working together across all levels of government and the community.
<p>My campaign is driven by a passion for education, not politics. I will fight to support our teachers, expand access to early education, modernize college and career readiness programs and advocate for the mental health and well-being of all students. Our schools must be safe, inclusive environments where every student can learn and succeed. I am committed to being a strong advocate for every student and family in our district.","<p>I have a unique combination of life and work experiences that have prepared me for this role, and I have the passion and commitment to our community that's needed to devote my energy to serving our students, families and teachers. As a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, I have demonstrated leadership and a dedication to service. My professional experience as a senior strategist at Coursera has given me a deep understanding of education trends, skills development and the future job market. Additionally, as a trustee for the Anne Arundel County Public Library, I have been a vocal advocate for freedom of information and inclusive access to resources.
<p>I am the only candidate in District 7 endorsed by the Teachers’ Association, a testament to my commitment to supporting educators and advocating for fair pay and benefits to retain the best talent. I am deeply invested in our community’s future and I have a strong understanding of the challenges we face, from expanding access to pre-kindergarten to ensuring mental health support for all students.
<p>I bring strategic and creative thinking, deep experience in organizational problem-solving, relationship building, and a genuine passion for making our schools the best they can be.","<p>The most important issue facing our school board is attracting and retaining high-quality educators. Great teachers are the foundation of a strong education system, but nationwide, we are facing a crisis in teacher recruitment and retention due to inadequate pay, benefits and professional support.

<p>If elected, I will advocate for policies that prioritize fair compensation, professional development and mentorship opportunities for our educators. I will work with county, state and school leadership to secure additional funding and resources to support these initiatives. We must also improve work-life balance for our teachers, give them more time to plan lessons, offer recognition and career advancement opportunities, and ensure they have access to essential services like the School Age Child Care program.
<p>Beyond compensation, I will champion creating a supportive and respectful work environment that values teachers as critical partners in our children’s success. This includes advocating for adequate mental health resources for both students and staff, reducing administrative burdens and fostering a culture of collaboration and innovation within our schools.
<p>By focusing on these areas, we can attract, develop and retain the educators our students need to succeed, ultimately improving outcomes for all children in our district.

His focus on expanding economic opportunity, improving education and addressing inequality reflects values I deeply share. Moore’s ability to connect with diverse communities and his emphasis on collaboration and inclusive growth resonate with my belief in leadership that brings people together to solve complex challenges. His commitment to creating a Maryland that works for everyone, particularly marginalized communities, inspires me to fight for every child’s right to a quality education and a brighter future.","<p>I support the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. It represents a strong step forward in ensuring that all Maryland students receive the education they deserve. By increasing funding for early childhood education, raising teacher pay, and setting rigorous college and career readiness standards, the Blueprint aligns closely with my priorities for our district.
<p>For Anne Arundel County, the Blueprint will provide much-needed resources to expand access to pre-kindergarten programs, support multilingual and economically disadvantaged families and modernize our career and technical education programs to meet the needs of a changing job market. It will also help us address the critical issue of teacher retention by improving compensation and professional development opportunities.
<p>However, implementing the Blueprint will require careful planning and collaboration across all levels of government. I am committed to working with county and state officials to secure the necessary funding and ensure that our district is positioned to take full advantage of these opportunities to improve outcomes for all students.","I fully support Superintendent Mark T. Bedell's new policy on student use of cellphones. There is no place for cellphones in our classrooms. The daily impact on our kids is overwhelmingly negative, and it is becoming an increasingly troublesome challenge for our teachers. Our first priority must be student outcomes: helping our students grow and preparing them for college, career and adulthood. The distraction and disruption of cellphones in the classroom have no positive, and only negative, effects on our student outcomes.
","While I believe our district has made progress in ensuring student safety, there is always more work to be done. We must continue to prioritize both physical safety — through secure facilities and strong adult presence — and emotional safety by expanding mental health support and anti-bullying initiatives. We should also invest in regular training for staff on crisis response and inclusive practices. Engaging the community in safety planning and maintaining open communication with parents are critical to fostering a safe and supportive environment for all students.","I oppose blanket bans or policies that allow individual parents to unilaterally remove books, as they can limit students' access to diverse perspectives and inhibit critical thinking. Our school libraries should remain places of exploration and learning. Access to books should only be restricted where they are not age-appropriate or contain content that violates established educational standards. Decisions on library materials selection and access should be made by trained educators and librarians, who consider the educational value, age appropriateness, and relevance of materials. ","I support policies that allow transgender and gender nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns without mandatory parental notification. The safety, privacy and well-being of students must be the priority. Forced disclosure can put students at risk of harm or rejection. Schools should foster a supportive environment that respects students' identities while encouraging open, voluntary communication with parents when appropriate. It is essential to balance the rights and safety of students with the desire for parental involvement in a thoughtful and compassionate manner."

In these roles, I advocate for students, administrators, families and communities in South County. Alongside my husband, Mathew, I am heavily invested in the local education system, with our four children attending Anne Arundel County Public Schools in the southern cluster.

Drawing from 14 years of volunteering experience and firsthand involvement with both special education and general tracks, I bring a wealth of insights to the table.

I will work to increase transparency and community engagement in decision-making processes, ensuring that the board is responsive to the needs and concerns of our diverse district.
<p>Ultimately, my goal is to build a more resilient, equitable and supportive education system that empowers every student to thrive academically and personally.",Candidate did not respond to this question.,"<p>The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is a vital step toward ensuring equitable and high-quality education for all students in Anne Arundel County, District 7. Its focus on early childhood education, teacher pay, and support for multilingual and economically disadvantaged families aligns with our district’s needs.
<p>Investing in early childhood education is crucial for closing achievement gaps before they widen. It will provide a solid foundation for students, particularly those from underserved communities. A forward-thinking school district understands to achieve our goals, we have to attract and retain professionals who are passionate about teaching. My entire life, my mother, a public school teacher, fought for higher and equitable compensation for women and teachers. It’s going to be an under-compensated, potentially difficult career. If we want the best geometry teachers to come to teach in Anne Arundel County Public Schools — knowing it’s an under-compensated and difficult career — we have to make it attractive to come and difficult to leave. If not salary, we should use our innovative and creative problem-solving skills to explore every potential opportunity to reduce out-of-pocket living expenses for teachers living and working in the county without taxpayer expense. We should be prioritize teachers.
<p>The emphasis on college and career readiness ensures that high school graduates are well-prepared for life beyond the classroom, whether they choose to enter the workforce or pursue higher education. This is especially important in District 7, where we need to ensure that students have opportunities to succeed in various career paths.
<p>Furthermore, the Blueprint’s focus on expanding services to multilingual families and those facing poverty will make our schools more inclusive. It is critical that every student, regardless of background, has access to the resources needed to thrive academically and socially.
<p>While the Blueprint promises transformative changes, its success in District 7 will depend on local implementation and community engagement. We must ensure these funds are allocated effectively to address the unique challenges our district faces, such as transportation safety and infrastructure improvements. I am committed to advocating for the best use of resources to benefit all students in our community.","<p>We are still too early to release a cellphone policy limiting use. We owe our students and Anne Arundel County Public Schools’ community the knowledge of managing digital tools in life. We teach digital classes — the cellphone is not the enemy. For many of us, it is our only computer .
<p>This regulation fails students with special needs, rural students, students who thrive in virtual environments and potentially more. The Anne Arundel County Public Schools communications have only recently reached the point of being timely and not providing alerts after the event. Anne Arundel County Public Schools need more time to restore trust with parents and students before moving to no direct contact between parent and child.
<p>I would also highlight the irony of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools mobile app being rolled out alongside the cellphone policy. How can I model the behavior you want from my child if you have me glued to the mobile app?","<p>While our school district has made commendable efforts to ensure student safety, there is still room for improvement. One critical area is the transportation system, where enhanced safety measures are necessary to ensure the well-being of students during their commutes. We need to prioritize upgrading school bus safety protocols, including driver training and bus maintenance, as well as ensuring safer pick-up and drop-off zones.
<p>Additionally, improving school infrastructure is essential to address safety concerns. This includes better surveillance systems, upgraded entry points and regular safety drills to prepare students and staff for emergencies. Another key area is as local communities create structured frameworks for mental health services, I will align with the Maryland Children’s Behavioral Roadmap, supporting a concerted effort to meet the mental health needs of our children at the local, county and state levels. Also expanding peer support programs and frameworks such as Mental Health First Aid, taught by the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps, in partnership with the Mental Health Association of Maryland. I am evaluating the impact of Maryland Department of Health’s temporary halt on new enrollments in specific behavioral health programs under the Maryland Medicaid Program. We have families that may be impacted.","<p>Decisions regarding book removal should involve a balanced committee, including educators, librarians, parents and community members. This ensures that a broad range of viewpoints is considered before taking action. The committee should follow clear, objective guidelines to assess books, focusing on educational relevance and appropriateness for different age groups.
<p>It is essential to maintain a diverse and inclusive library that reflects a wide range of experiences and ideas while protecting students from harmful content. Open dialogue and community involvement are key to making these decisions responsibly.","Candidate did not respond to this question.

Calvert County District 1,Mike Shisler,y,null,null,mikeshisler@comcast.net,74,Retired.,"Doctorate from George Mason University in 2000. Focus was curriculum and instruction, with a minor in geography.
","I am running because I want to continue to serve our kids, staff and community. I believe our school district has made good progress in the past 10-15 years in making sure that our schools provide an equitable education for all of our kids. While we have made progress, we still have much to do to make sure that each of our students is respected, protected and loved. 
","<p>I have over 47.5 years of experience as an educator. I started as a Peace Corps teacher in the Central African Republic. When I returned home, I taught middle school in Baltimore City.
<p>I taught high school English for half a year in Anne Arundel County. I took a career detour and drove for UPS and for Mayflower. I wanted to get back to teaching. I spent 10 years as an elementary school teacher and 33 years as an elementary school administrator, all at Beach Elementary.
<p>My Peace Corps mentor told us to “go home and grow in your own backyard.” Well, the Beach community became my backyard. I learned a lot from the Beach community. I learned over the years at Beach that our kids need to learn to think well, learn to work well with others, and learn the skills needed to become active citizens in our democracy. I believe the ultimate goal of our public schools is to produce active citizens who have a responsibility to each other and to the common good.","I believe that fair and full funding is our most critical issue. That became crystal clear after the drama and contention involved with getting our fiscal year 2025 Board of Education budget adopted and passed. During that marathon, I learned that our county is among the top 20 wealthiest counties in the nation, and among the top five wealthiest in Maryland. Why do we battle every year to fund the needs of our students and our staff? Why do we look at education as a cost, rather than as an investment? We need to move beyond the scarcity mindset and the zero-sum games that are played when we find our schools.","Robert Reich. Reich was the secretary of labor in the Clinton Administration. He has recently retired from active teaching at University of California, Berkeley. He's an economist, and he continues to teach the rest of us about how our economy and government could and should work for the benefit of all of its citizens. Also, he is an amazing quick-draw artist and cartoonist. I think his messages about equity and fairness apply well to our schools, and society at large.","The U.S. has a long legacy of 10-year educational reform efforts. Each previous effort died out because the funding did not follow the promises. We are beginning to see that happening again with the recent warnings from Gov. Wes Moore about Maryland's revenue sources. If we continue to see education as a cost rather than as an investment, then folks will just wait for this latest reform to fade away. That would be a great pity. The Blueprint is an opportunity to level the playing field for all kids in Maryland. It is a chance to improve our common good and to step away from the traditional hierarchy with its ladder of the rich and powerful at the top and the poorer hanging on to the lower rungs. I hope we will have the guts to stay the course with the Blueprint.","<p>Cellphones are the latest offspring from Pandora's box. Calvert County, like other districts, has adopted new guidelines to restrict the use of cellphones. Secondary students are to keep their phones off and out of sight during the instructional day. This problem did not happen overnight, and it will not be solved overnight. When did a cellphone move from being a ""want"" to a ""need""? Cellphones have moved beyond a distraction to being an addiction — an addiction that brings increased social pressures and the need for constant social validation.                                                                                                                                          
<p>We'll still have much to do to counterbalance the impacts of the screen world. I expect that there'll be some pushback, but I hope the new phone policies will be steps in the right direction.","We can never be satisfied, because satisfaction leads to complacency. Guns and weapons are a major issue in our society at large. We have strengthened our schools with coded entries, sealed in lobbies, exterior and interior cameras, but...  school safety depends on physical safety and mental and emotional safety. Our schools and our society have much to do in all three areas. Let's not kid ourselves that we are safe with more codes and cameras.","I don't agree with book bans. Book bans are a free speech issue, which means it's a free thinking and free reading issue. I trust the school librarians. I trust them to preview their book collections and to provide a wide variety of books that would be age-appropriate for their students. Parents have the right to determine that their child/ren should not read a particular book. But parents do not have the right to make those decisions for other kids or other parents. Book banning is a treacherous slope. Parents need to be ready and step up when their kids ask “Why” or “Why not?” about a certain book.","I presume students will make those pronoun choices when they are in middle or high school.
If that's the district policy, then I think it's the district's duty to tell parents that the policy exists and to urge parents to have discussions with their kids. I believe those family discussions would lead to fewer family surprises.

Closing the restrooms is not a solution.",Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. ,"The Blueprint is unfunded and full of mandates that will strain local school systems and their taxpayers.  It was vetoed by Gov. Larry Hogan before being overridden by the state legislature. The Blueprint, while well intended, is focused around the belief that if you just throw enough money at a problem, it will go away or improve. There are pay rate requirements and position requirements (more administrators instead of more teachers) that may not really be needed in improving our education system in Calvert County. The Blueprint requires funding full day pre-school, a decrease in teaching time (requiring more teachers), etc., all of which drive up costs to the taxpayers. With funding taken away by the state, the only way to fund this is to increase property tax — unacceptable. Calvert County currently pays $18,200 per student, Baltimore County pays $23,200 per student. Does anyone think more money would solve the problems in Baltimore?","Cellphones should not be used in school. They are distracting to our students and teachers. Unless there is an assignment that requires their use, cellphones should be off and/or locked away during the school day.","No. While there have been improvements this year, we still have students afraid to use the restroom due to safety concerns. We need to enforce the student code of conduct consistently across the board and have our school resource officers more involved with safety within the building, versus having the majority of shots called from school administration. ",Any books of a sexual nature should not be in our schools. They serve no educational purpose and should not be in a school library available to students under the age of 18.  ,There should be nothing held back from the parents.

","I am running because I care deeply about the students, teachers and staff of Calvert County Public Schools and will work hard to ensure that we invest in an education that equips every student for success in life. My family moved here 35 years ago because the school system was one of the best in Maryland. I am proud that my children graduated from our public schools with a great education, but the future for today’s students holds both new opportunities and new challenges that we must be prepared to meet. There has been much progress in recent years to expand opportunities for all students, and yet there are those that push back against progress with political agendas that are neither student-focused or sensible. Securing a great education for our students requires us to leave behind personal political agendas and work collaboratively to build and support educational opportunities and excellence for all students. I’m running because I have extensive experience as an engaged Calvert County Public Schools parent, professional expertise in negotiating and budget management and a firm belief that every student deserves an excellent education. ","<p>For the reasons listed just above, I am a good candidate for the board. Additionally, my professional experience has provided me with essential skills for a Board of Education member. For the last 18 months, I have faithfully attended our Board of Education meetings and witnessed their discussions and votes on policies, construction, maintenance and contracts.  
<p>My career with Freestate Electrical, a union electrical company, provides me with an understanding of construction bids, terms, and the necessity of preventative maintenance and upkeep. As a contracts manager, I research clauses from a variety of sources, listen to the experts in the field and negotiate for fair contracts. As an AR manager I work with large sets of data examining discrepancies and resolving problems; this level of detail will be crucial when reviewing the budget. My children have attended the Calvert County Public Schools from pre-kindergarten to high school, including the Career and Technology Academy, and I know that an effective school system requires collaboration and cooperation from students, staff, teachers, administration, parents/guardians and the community.","The most important issue facing our school board is funding. Without fully funding our educational system we are not able to reassure teachers and staff that their positions are secure, purchase laptops for all our students, support our sports, arts, theater, writing programs, mathletes, provide adequate maintenance for our schools, build new schools, and promote programs that will help our students successfully navigate the school system. My 29 years experience as a contracts and AR manager gives me the knowledge and expertise to examine the budget and promote how our administrators have been fiscally responsible and saved money by utilizing different programs for our school system. By using concrete examples of conscientious budgeting we can advocate for more funding from our community. ","I admire Sen. Chris Van Hollen. I appreciate that he started his political career as a state delegate and then state senator, so he knows the needs of all Marylanders before being elected to Congress and then the Senate. In all political arenas, Sen. Van Hollen has supported education and fully funding educational programs. My children went to a Title I elementary school, and because of the additional funding received, they had access to programs that benefited them at an early age.","The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is an important document for the school systems and deserves universal support. Our teachers and support staff pay should be increased, Head Start programs will be crucial in laying the foundation of educational achievement, funds should follow the students who need additional help. Calvert County Public Schools has an amazing Career and Technology Academy, and our advanced placement and dual enrollment programs are well established. The issue with the Blueprint is that the State of Maryland and the federal government have not fully funded the program, and we need to increase our communication with our community to explain how an investment in schools through the Blueprint is beneficial to all our futures.","The Calvert County Public Schools have updated its Code of Conduct for the 2024-2025 school year where students may bring their phone/smartwatch, but the device must be powered completely off and remain in a non-visible, secure location with the exception of administratively approved classroom activities and lunchtime. I approve of this policy and have heard from many educators that the restriction on cellphones has resulted in significant improvements in the classrooms.","You always worry about the safety of your students, but I am confident that Mr. Larry Titus (the district’s supervisor of student services) continually works to improve school safety, and I would communicate with educators and students to hear their feedback. Calvert County Public Schools has at least one safety advocate and school resource officer at each middle school and high school, and I would ask for feedback from students, staff and teachers about the need for additional safety advocates. I would advocate for hiring additional counselors and mediators, as well as promoting more mental health programs, so students learn how to communicate and resolve issues before problems escalate. ","Calvert County Public Schools in 2021 received the American Association of School Librarians' National School Library of the Year Award. School librarians choose books for their school population, ensuring individual and diverse students' needs are met. The library program supports student choice in what they would like to read and reading for fun increases comprehension and critical thinking skills which translates into lifelong learning. If a parent/guardian would like a book to be reconsidered there is a formal process that is followed, and I support that.",There are federal laws and Maryland Department of Education guidelines that the Calvert County Public Schools must follow.

",Bachelor of science in biology from the College of William and Mary.,"<p>I am uniquely qualified to lead our school system in a way that sets students up for success. This includes having been a dedicated local public education advocate for 10 years, fighting for the resources students and educators need. The Carroll County Education Association recognized those efforts with their Friend of Education Award in 2023. The focus of the board needs to return to academics, instead of the deeply divisive culture wars. The current board has too much allegiance to Carroll’s political power structure and no representation from the southwestern part of the county. My husband and I put down roots in Mount Airy largely because of the excellent public schools. We need to keep them that way. That matters not only to Carroll County Public Schools families but also to their neighbors without kids in the system because strong schools translate to safe, friendly, economically prosperous communities. 
<p>Our current Board of Education is badly out of balance. We need to cultivate a community where every voice is heard and valued. We need to come together on common ground with our common values front and center. We need to elect people who genuinely believe in the promise of public education, who center decisions around putting students first, who recognize and deeply admire how amazing teachers and other educators are, and who can contribute to a climate that makes learning fun. I model those traits and will work incredibly hard on behalf of every family. 
","<p>I am proud to be endorsed by the Carroll County Education Association and Carroll Association of School Employees. 
<p>Professionally, I am the corporate relations officer at the National Aquarium. My nonprofit management career confers many applicable skills and leadership qualities: staff supervision, budgeting, strategic planning, committee and board relations, commitment to mission-driven service, creativity, tenacity, and optimism. 
<p>Right out of college, I worked with hundreds of children as an informal environmental educator. This included conducting assembly presentations with live exotic animals and facilitating farm animal encounters in addition to program development and interpretive signage production. 
<p>My husband and I raised two kids as active Carroll County Public Schools parent-volunteers. They attended from kindergarten through 12th-grade graduation (one during COVID). Having parented two students at every grade level, I have a deep knowledge of the system, policies, and personnel. As a candidate in 2018, I visited every school and interviewed every principal. 
<p>My upbringing in a military family that moved often entailed attending eight different schools growing up, including overseas. I experienced a wide range of learning environments and made friends with classmates from all walks of life.
<p>I co-founded and co-led a nonpartisan grassroots group, VOCAL Carroll County, to promote civic engagement and good local governance. Accomplishments include advocating for a state-compliant ethics ordinance for Carroll County government; getting out the informed vote in municipal elections with the Main Streets Matter campaign, and partnering with other civics-focused groups like the local League of Women Voters and Braver Angels.","<p>I think it is nearly impossible to choose one clear challenge that is predominant among the many serious issues facing public education in general and Carroll County Public Schools specifically. They are all complex and interconnected. None can be simply solved by the board alone. Because the teacher shortage poses the biggest threat, their greatest concern currently is the one we must take most seriously immediately: the increasing behavioral issues in classrooms. I address that partly in my responses to the school safety and cellphone policy questions. In addition, I would prioritize a review of discipline and other policies that impact educators’ and administrators’ ability to manage behavior, engaging parents as partners. 
<p>Beyond that, the ability to recruit and retain high-quality teachers is mandatory and multi-faceted. I would endeavor to be a good employer of all school staff. Providing competitive compensation, improving working conditions, and cultivating a climate of camaraderie are all keys to making Carroll County Public Schools a preferred place to work. 
<p>I believe that the single most important thing that school systems can do to improve the efficacy of instruction, educator satisfaction, and school performance is to empower educators and elevate their voices. They are second only to students as important internal stakeholders. I would advocate for a more frequent, robust formal platform for learning from them the best way to overcome behavioral and other barriers to continuously improve academic performance. ","With my lifelong passion for wildlife conservation, I have long admired Dr. Jane Goodall and was thrilled when I had the opportunity to hear her speak in person and meet her briefly when I worked for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. As a scientist she has done extensive, groundbreaking work with global reach. Her fierce intellect and huge heart are a formidable combination. She has pursued her work with tireless diligence, integrity, strength and kindness. Renowned as primatologist, her impact goes beyond chimpanzees and Africa as she is a champion for wildlife and wild places worldwide. I am also inspired by how — at age 90 — she hasn’t let up or rested on her laurels. She is a stellar example for any of us who wish to lead a purpose-driven life that includes service to our community and planet.","<p>The Blueprint’s goals are all evidence-based and have great potential to advance Maryland’s public education system. Without it I do not believe the recent and long overdue increases in teacher salary and implementation of the career ladder would have happened. That was rightly the highest priority but it isn’t enough to ensure a high-quality public education for every child.
<p>However, the Blueprint is ambitious, unwieldy and expensive. Its mandates do not adequately account for the unique situations in every county. It should and is likely to evolve. But there are some narratives around it in Carroll County that concern me as I think they could ultimately be counter-productive, despite being mostly well-intentioned (although calling for its abolition is naïve at best). I expect it is here to stay, and so local leaders must positively partner with decision makers at the state level and respectfully and optimistically engage with lawmakers to make legislative modifications. 
<p>The combative posture of many local officials diminishes our ability to help ourselves. We must cultivate cooperation to make needed changes to the Blueprint. Meaningful, mutually respectful collaboration along with diligence, data, thoughtfulness and innovation will be necessary for staff and the board to ensure fair, successful implementation locally. 
<p>In addition, many complaints about the funding predicament at the county level fail to acknowledge that our school system would be much better positioned to reallocate resources if it had not been forced to operate under austerity conditions for a decade.","The dangers of an open internet and social media for young people are undisputed. So is the disruption to the learning environment of easy access to extraneous electronics in the classroom. Most classroom educators are completely clear about the magnitude of this problem, although parents have more widely varying opinions with many preferring a more permissive approach.
<p>The best policy allows educators complete authority in the classroom, with the full support of administration. Elementary-age students do not need phones at school (if at all). Middle school-age students can learn good digital citizenship—with severely limited access, strictly enforced. At high school, young adults have responsibilities that require access to communications during the day, so I oppose completely restricting access during free time. In all cases, communication and guidance for students and parents that encourages willing cooperation is ideal to promote buying into the importance of compliance.","<p>Carroll County Public Schools have excellent personnel in its Office of School Security, a dedicated volunteer Security Advisory Council, robust relationships with law enforcement, nonprofits, and community groups, plus an amazing asset in its School Resource Officer (SRO) program. However, increasing behavioral challenges are directly impacting instruction, safety and overall school climate.
<p>Working with nonprofit organizations and agencies that address mental health and behavioral issues — including risk and threat assessment as well as targeted interventions — is crucial. Partnering with parents and community groups that pursue anti-bullying initiatives is also worthwhile. I would prioritize this multi-pronged approach to addressing the situation and improving the safety of students and staff alike.","I agree that “sexually gratuitous” material is not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful. I support the Carroll County Public Schools material review process as it was intended to operate, which may result in the infrequent removal of a book or two. However, the expertise of professionals trained to select developmentally appropriate material should be respected, and overriding their judgment should be exceedingly rare. Reasonable mechanisms can be put in place to honor the wishes of parents who wish to restrict what their own children access without violating the rights of other parents. As an institution of learning with a mission of preparing lifelong learners for life, the last thing Carroll County Public Schools should do is prop up book banning efforts by outside political groups that have dramatically reduced the number available for eager young adult readers. Material that is challenging is essential for achieving excellence, and I support the freedom to read.","Discussions and decisions around these policies and others related to the rights and responsibilities of school systems toward transgender and gender nonconforming students must be conducted thoughtfully, sensitively and respectfully in good faith. They must also recognize the rights of other students, staff and all parents/guardians. The legal landscape around students’ rights to privacy and parents’ rights to information is a foundational factor, as is the safety of students — which is the primary and legitimate justification for these policies. Current guidance from the Maryland State Department of Education affirms the authority of local education agencies to adopt these policies. They have also been tested and affirmed in federal court. I would not personally pursue such a policy in Carroll County Public Schools at this time for multiple reasons, including concerns about the conversation itself causing harm to the students it would be intended to protect."
Carroll County,Amanda Jozkowski,y,amandaj4boe.com,https://www.facebook.com/AmandaJ4BOE,amandaj4boe@gmail.com,40,"Associate professor of occupational therapy and occupational science; Graduate Program director, Towson University. Licensed and registered occupational therapy practitioner in the state of Maryland. 
","Doctorate in occupational science, University of Southern California.","<p>As a parent of three school-aged children, I am deeply invested in the future of Carroll County Public Schools. I want to help our school system, which is at the heart of our community, remain strong and focused on the success of every student. My professional background as an occupational therapist and professor equips me with a unique perspective on child development, educational best practices, support services for students with learning and healthcare needs and the importance of inclusive, evidence-based policies.
<p>In recent years, I have become increasingly concerned with the politicization of public education. Decisions that impact our children should be driven by data, best practices and the needs of our students and educators — not by partisan agendas. I want to eliminate division and distraction and refocus the board’s efforts on what matters most: ensuring that every student has access to a high-quality education that prepares them for life after graduation, whether that means college, career or other pursuits.
<p>My campaign is centered on collaboration, community engagement, competence and care. I will advocate for board decisions to be made in the best interest of every student. By partnering with parents, educators, and community members, the Board of Education can evolve Carroll County Public Schools into a world-class school system where every educator feels supported, every child feels they belong and every family is heard. I humbly ask for your vote to serve our community and protect the public schools that make Carroll County such a great place to live and learn.","<p>My experiences as a parent, educator and public education advocate qualify me to be an exceptional leader for our schools and are key reasons that my running mate Muri Lynn Dueppen and I are endorsed by both the Carroll County educators and school employee associations. As an occupational therapy professor with a research focus on therapeutic play and development, I have built deep connections with families navigating increasingly complex special education/accommodation policies and processes. I have a strong understanding of educational systems and education-related legislation at the local, state and federal levels, and have been a vocal proponent for issues including sufficient funding, teacher support and accessibility for many years. 
<p>I am also directly invested in the future of our school system as the parent of children who attend Carroll County Public Schools. I actively participate in school activities, serving on the parent-teacher association, two county-level committees, and volunteering in classrooms. My involvement gives me firsthand insight into the day-to-day challenges and opportunities in our schools.
<p>My professional background equips me with the skills needed to measure and analyze data, build consensus, and make informed decisions. My leadership experience in strategic planning and budget management will help ensure that our schools are well-resourced and that taxpayer dollars are used effectively. I believe in listening to the community and being a voice for parents, educators and students. <p>My goal is to bring a balanced, thoughtful approach to the board, focusing on practical solutions that benefit all stakeholders in our community.","<p>Students need a school environment in which they feel safe, supported and ready to learn. However, the intersection of classroom behavior, teacher support and student mental health (deeply interconnected factors that directly impact the quality of education) is a major challenge to this goal. 
<p>Classroom disruptions and bullying are increasingly driven by stressors that students face, such as mental health challenges and the overuse/misuse of technology — particularly social media and inaccurate or untrustworthy sources of information. These issues not only create barriers to learning, but also contribute to teacher burnout as educators struggle to manage behavioral issues while meeting academic demands. Understanding and addressing the root causes of behavior can help reduce harm to students and staff and create a more supportive school environment.
<p>If elected, I will prioritize more comprehensive supports for both students and educators. This would include hiring more counselors, social workers and classroom support staff, and providing ongoing training for teachers on managing classroom behavior and recognizing early signs of mental health issues. I will advocate for continued partnership with school resource officers and the Sheriff's Office, and the integration of preventive measures in our disciplinary policies to keep students engaged and reduce the reliance on exclusionary practices such as seclusion. I will work to make sure educators are supported, by both administrators and school system policy, to effectively manage their classrooms without excessive paperwork or fear of injury or litigation. ","<p>Throughout her career, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg demonstrated the power of perseverance and principled leadership. Her work on the Supreme Court, particularly in the areas of gender equality and civil liberties, has had a profound impact on American society.
<p>Justice Ginsburg’s ability to build consensus and her dedication to upholding the Constitution, even in the face of significant opposition, are qualities I deeply respect. She showed that one could be both firm in their convictions and open to dialogue and compromise. This balance is critical to effective public service and is a leadership style I aim to emulate.
<p>As a Board of Education member, I will draw on Justice Ginsberg’s model of dedication to fairness, and her belief in the importance of equal opportunity, as I work to ensure that every student in Carroll County has access to a safe, inclusive and high-quality education.","<p>The Blueprint represents a significant investment in the future of Maryland’s education system. Its focus on equity, accountability and excellence aligns with my values as well as the research on how best to support student success. Provisions for increased funding for high-needs students and emphasis on early childhood education and career readiness will help close achievement gaps and prepare students for life beyond high school. In Carroll County, the Blueprint will provide the resources needed to enhance educational offerings and pay teachers more competitively. I support the Blueprint’s goals and will work to align our district’’s budget and policies with its pillars. 
<p>While the Blueprint offers many benefits, its implementation will require careful planning and collaboration to overcome potential obstacles — just as with any large, long-term piece of legislation. I will work with local, state and federal leadership to advocate for sufficient and sustained funding and to address the logistical challenges of implementing new programs and practices across diverse school districts. The Carroll County Public Schools Board of Education must partner with the state to articulate the unique needs and values of our county, and request flexibility in implementation where feasible and appropriate. 
<p>If elected, I will seek to provide ongoing professional development and support to educators and staff to effectively implement Blueprint initiatives. Utilizing my background in program assessment and accreditation, I will work to monitor and evaluate the impact of Blueprint policies to confirm they are achieving the desired outcomes and make necessary adjustments as indicated.","<p>I support a balanced approach, recognizing both the potential benefits of phones/other devices, and the need to minimize distractions in the classroom. 
<p>Devices can be valuable tools for learning and communication, but they can also disrupt the educational environment if not managed appropriately. Parents are rightly concerned with the ability to contact their children in the event of an emergency — in the era of increased school violence, I understand this concern. 
<p>Carroll County Public Schools should implement a modern policy that allows devices to be used for educational purposes under teacher supervision, but restricts use and access during instructional time for non-academic activities. I will advocate for clearer guidelines on when/how devices can be used at school, and the consequences for violation of this policy. 
<p>Responsible technology use must also be reinforced at home, so educators can effectively monitor and respond to inappropriate device use while sustaining a focused learning environment.","<p>Ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all students is a top priority, and I believe we should continuously assess and update our safety measures. One area for improvement is the enhancement of mental health support and preventive strategies, which are proven to reduce the risk of both school violence and self-harm behaviors. By focusing on early intervention and providing students with the resources they need to manage stress, anxiety and other challenges, we can prevent many safety issues before they escalate. 
<p>I will work to create a culture of respect and mutual accountability at all levels in Carroll County Public Schools and support ongoing partnerships with local law enforcement to ensure that our schools are well-prepared for any potential threats. The Board of Education must maintain open lines of communication with parents and the community to build trust and make certain that everyone is informed and involved in keeping our schools safe.","Books should be carefully curated by educational professionals, such as media specialists and teachers, who are trained to assess whether materials are developmentally appropriate and align with educational goals. While there may be rare instances where a book is deemed unsuitable for the school library, these decisions should be based on clear, consistent criteria focused on educational value, not on censorship or ideological preferences. 

The decision to remove a book should be made through a transparent process involving educators, administrators, and, when appropriate, with input from parents and students. I will work to ensure such decisions are made thoughtfully, considering the educational needs of every student. We must respect students' freedom to read developmentally appropriate materials that reflect accurate history and diverse viewpoints, and support parents’ right to limit their own child’s access to material they deem objectionable.
","<p>School policies that allow transgender and gender nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns while withholding this information from their parents are complex and should be carefully considered. On one hand, schools have a duty to create a safe and supportive environment for all students, which includes respecting their gender identity. For some students, disclosing preferred pronouns to their parents could lead to rejection or direct harm, which schools must avoid for both legal and ethical reasons. 
<p>However, I also believe in the importance of partnership between schools and families. Parents play the most critical role in their children's lives—their involvement is essential to a child’s healthy mental, emotional, and physical development. Ideally, schools should work to build trust with students and parents, facilitating conversations that respect the student's privacy and identity while also keeping parents informed in a way that supports their child's safety and well-being.

Carroll County,Greg Malveaux,y,gregmalveaux.org,https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100095474679804,gregmalveaux4boe@gmail.com,53,"Professor of English composition and literature and am the college-wide coordinator of study abroad at Montgomery College.
",A doctorate in education and administration from Morgan State University.,"As the father of a Carroll County public school student, I deeply care about the future of my son and all of the children in the current school system. I’m a 25+-year educator and have seen firsthand the learning loss that has occurred with our students over the years. I want to bring curriculum that supports increased academic achievement to our students. I believe that we need to get back to basics and focus on traditional curriculum — math, reading, science and writing, as well as physical education, art, music and languages. With a strong educational foundation, our children will have pathways for future success with a trade, admission to college, or access into the workforce right out of high school. I am also running for the board because school safety and classroom disruptions are a major concern. There’s been a major increase in physical altercations amongst our elementary school students. I will push for policies that give teachers and administrators authority to address disruptive student behavior in the classroom. Also, I am running for the board to help retain local control, and I support opt-out classes when state-mandated curriculum misses the mark for values held by Carroll County citizens. Also, I understand that many of our residents are struggling in these difficult economic times, and I want to be very watchful, while on the board, that no needless spending occurs for Carroll County taxpayers. Every taxpayer dollar must be carefully accounted for.","I am a lifelong Maryland resident, and a 25+-year educator with a doctorate in education and administration. I have taught students in grades kindergarten-8, and currently do so in grades 9-12 through a dual enrollment program; my teaching experience has given me a strong understanding for curriculum development and educational delivery. I am honored by the great outreach of support that I have received from Carroll County Public School teachers and educators during this campaign. In addition, I am an administrator coordinating study abroad for an institution that serves 60,000 students. I’ve managed significant budgets and tailored curriculum for students. I am also the proud father of a Carroll County public school student, and I serve on the parent-teacher organization at my son’s school. A majority of our elected officials, including legislators, commissioners, law enforcement, county Board of Education members and mayors support me. I am proud of the fact that all of these supporters recognize my values, priorities and initiatives as beneficial for helping our children, Carroll County schools, families, teachers and school administrators — not to mention Carroll County taxpayers. With having established a strong rapport with community leaders and elected officials, starting on Day 1 with the board, I would be ready to learn from, and work collectively with, others to meet the challenges facing our schools.  ","There are a couple major issues of importance facing our school board, and since one is not more important than the other, I would like to address both. First, we have a pandemic of physical altercations and class disruptions occurring in our elementary schools. School safety is a great concern. If elected to the board, I would advocate for preventative measures to be put in place, including manageable classroom sizes, parental involvement, a major presence of security resource officers and using student mentors; in addition, I would support legislation to empower teachers and administrators with classroom behavior issues. To curb bullying and classroom distractions, I would also call for minimal cellphone presence in school. An equally important issue in our schools is the need to get back to basics. We must raise student academic achievement by refocusing on traditional curriculum — reading, writing, math and science. A strong educational foundation will provide our students future pathways to college entrance, a trade or a career right out of high school. This can be achieved by creating opportunities for our students. Students can work with local businesses to take part in internship opportunities, with local trade unions that give instruction in a classroom setting, with local tutoring businesses to provide additional learning outside of school or assistance with homework, and participate with nonprofit organizations with members who visit student classes.","I can recall my time in 10th grade when I desired academic and social change. I had always done well in the public school setting, but at this particular time, at this particular place, I still felt a need to alter my academic approach. I would go on to spend a few years at a Montessori school and came to greatly admire the Italian educator, Maria Montessori, who had developed the Montessori educational approach. As a hands-on learner who did not necessarily learn everything at the same pace as others, I embraced the self-directed learning environment and the principles that fostered independence and personal growth. I am the product of both a public school and Montessori model, and admire the vision of the educator, Maria Montessori. I would like to carry on her creativity and ingenuity in meeting the individual needs of each student in the public school system.  ","The Blueprint brings both benefits and challenges for Carroll County Public Schools. With considering benefits, it will increase the minimum teacher salary to $60,000 by 2026. However, I wish that our full-time education support professionals had been included in the plan. Other positive initiatives include bringing additional mental health professionals and support staff in school; assisting students with multiple tracks in high school that lead to college, a technical trade or immediate entry into the workforce; and offering pre-kindergarten services to young learners. However, challenges also come with the Blueprint. There will be great difficulty in assuring all of its initiatives are funded and I commit to working alongside state and local government leaders to find ways we can meet many, if not all, of these provisions. Specific challenges that come with the Blueprint include its 60/40 teaching mandate. As a result, Carroll and other school districts in Maryland will have a difficult time finding highly qualified teachers to fill the gaps created by this mandate, and there will be an immense cost (over $20 million annually) to hire additional staff and assure fair wages and benefits for these new employees. We also need to be concerned with the fact that uncertified teachers have risen in excess of 20%. I share some concerns with our commissioners in Carroll County concerning the Blueprint, and as a board member I would work with them to find solutions that best serve the county needs while ensuring that we spend every taxpayer dollar wisely and effectively.","I support the new limits being placed on cellphones in middle and high schools. I understand parents’ concerns that cellphones be allowed in school in case of emergency situations. However, cellphones should not be present during class periods, during class change, and at lunch where important socialization can occur. Our teachers and staff agree. In a recent survey done in Carroll County Public Schools, nearly two out of three teachers and staff related that middle school students should not have access to cellphones during lunch, and well over half noted that high school students should not have access to cellphones during class change. Overall, less cellphone use in school tends to lead to less bullying and classroom disruptions, and brings an increase in student academic success and socialization.  ","Carroll County has one of the safest school systems in the state, and I hope to keep it that way. It is essential for every student, no matter their race, ethnicity, economic background or orientation, to be given a safe and healthy learning environment. This occurs with having preventative measures in place, including a reduction in cellphones to reduce intimidation and classroom disruptions. In addition, peer mentoring can improve mental health for students and create greater social bonds between students. Also, school officials and parents need to be cautious with the type of learning apps that are downloaded on children’s laptops. Security resource officers bring safety and mentorship to schools, particularly in middle and high schools. In addition, our schools need to actively engage with outside groups that address school safety, such as “Bee a Rae of Sunshine Foundation,” which focuses on bullying and youth mental health issues.  ","For decades I’ve taught literature, including African American literature, that has continuously challenged students to delve into difficult subject matter and historic occurrences. The material applies to that class’s themes and objectives. The quality of the book, and not the race, ethnicity or orientation of the author, determines the work’s presence in the curriculum. I also know that books taught in my college-level class may not be age-appropriate material for middle school students or their school libraries. I support Carroll County Education Association’s stance to not condone materials that are sexually gratuitous in nature, and I support the removal of such books from school libraries. It is very important that we follow federal, state, and local laws that restrict a student’s access to age-inappropriate materials. I appreciate the service and experience of librarians and staff to ensure we present students with ideal learning resources that increase rigor and challenge critical thinking.","I support all children, no matter their race, orientation or economic status. No child should be intimidated or bullied. I will make sure this remains the case for every student. It is important for all students to be respected and accommodated within reason. Preferred pronouns and gender ID labeling can create confusion. This is why I support the current Board of Education’s stance that a meeting between student, teacher and parent be made to approve the new pronoun or gender identification for the student. This way, everyone is on the same page. Research shows that students excel more when parents are involved in school. Transparency between school staff, the student and parents assist with this.   "
Carroll County,Kristen E.

As a conservative lifelong resident, mother of two, small business owner and active community member, I believe in the importance of education that reflects our community's values. I am passionate about ensuring that our schools continue to provide a strong foundation for our children's futures, where they can grow, learn and prepare for successful careers. My goal is to uphold the family and community values that make our county exceptional.","<p>My candidacy for the school board is grounded in both my experience and a deep commitment to upholding strong educational values. With over 15 years of success in business as an owner and manager, I understand how to:
<p>-Set budgets and allocate resources 
<p>-Meet regulatory obligations 
<p>-Establish collaborative relationships and 
<p>-Pursue strategic goals 
<p>Serving as president of the parent/teacher association, I find myself immersed in my children’s school, and I am loving my experience there as I gain keen insights into educators’ needs and the needs of parents and students alike. Other community leadership roles, both past and present, have also provided me with valuable core skill sets, experience and insight directly applicable to service on the school board. Such roles include:
<p>-President of the Board of the Senior Provider Information Network
<p>-Executive board member for Habitat for Humanity of Carroll County 
<p>-Committee member for The Partnership for a Healthier Carroll 
<p>-Committee member for the Youth Service Bureau's Philanthropy Committee  
<p>These experiences make me uniquely qualified to serve effectively on the school board, where thoughtful decision-making and collaborative leadership are paramount.","I believe that the most critical issue facing our school board is the prioritization of academic achievement and rigor in our schools. The recent 2023-2024 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program results reveal that only 64.8% of Carroll County students are proficient in English Language Arts and just 37.7% are proficient in mathematics. Although Carroll County ranks among the top three counties in the state in these categories, these figures nevertheless indicate significant room for improvement. It is my conviction that every decision made by the school board should prioritize the enhancement of academic excellence to ensure that all students reach their full potential.","<p>I admire Ronald Reagan, the president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. He played a pivotal role in revitalizing conservatism during the mid-to-late 20th century by advocating for smaller government, lower taxes and free-market economics. His economic policies were instrumental in curbing inflation and stimulating economic growth, leaving a lasting impact on the U.S. economy.
<p>Reagan's leadership was also crucial in the peaceful resolution of the Cold War. His firm stance against the Soviet Union, combined with strategic diplomatic efforts, helped bring an end to this prolonged global conflict. Often referred to as “The Great Communicator,” Reagan's optimistic vision and effective communication skills restored national confidence and reignited a sense of American pride.","I believe that the Blueprint for Maryland's Future imposes unnecessary constraints on local control and autonomy, particularly in counties like Carroll that consistently perform among the best in the state. I advocate for empowering local elected officials to design and implement education plans tailored to their respective communities, within their own budgets. I am optimistic after Gov. Wes Moore's recent comments in an interview with Fox45, wherein he acknowledged the need for adjustments to the Blueprint’s implementation and emphasized the importance of a plan with broad support and a feasible financial pathway.","The National Institutes of Health has found that heavy smartphone use among adolescents contributes to chronic sleep deprivation, poor academic performance and impaired cognitive and socio-emotional functioning. I am a strong advocate for making our schools cellphone-free zones. I fully support an “off and away” policy, respected and supported by parents and uniformly enforced by all school administrators, teachers and staff.","I support full funding and the potential expansion of Sheriff James T. DeWees’s nationally recognized Student Resource Officer program, as well as the efforts of Carroll County Public Schools’ Security and Emergency Management Department. I am grateful for the critical role these programs play in ensuring the safety and security of our students, teachers and staff. ","<p>I fully support students’ ability to access supplemental materials representing multiple viewpoints  and their right to be taught academic subjects from varying perspectives. When materials are open to question, I default to parental consent.  
<p>Regarding books that are sexually explicit in nature, I would state unequivocally that I do not condone materials that are sexually gratuitous in nature or feature extreme sexual content, including graphic depictions of sex and/or rape, in our school libraries.",Parents should be fully informed about everything happening at school involving their child. There should NEVER be a situation where information is withheld from parents.

","Opportunity. That's the answer I have given throughout my tenure as a board member. Providing every child, regardless of socio/economic background, the opportunity to succeed after graduating from Charles County Public Schools. I came from a childhood where I didn’t have a lot of resources or opportunity, and I’m keenly aware of the struggles many families have. Public education is the great equalizer, and I want to ensure that students and parents that commit to Charles County Public Schools are offered equitable opportunities so they can succeed. I represent all stakeholders in the system (teachers, parents, students, taxpayers) and hold myself accountable to them by maintaining high academic standards and fiscal accountability. I marched, lobbied and testified for the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which is a transformational tool that will provide additional resources for students and families. I have fostered programs to help students achieve college credit and certifications in high demand areas. This will greatly reduce the financial burden on families and allow graduates to attend college locally and work and live in our county. My desire is that students can graduate from Charles County Public Schools and enter college or the workforce locally and grow roots to strengthen our community.","As a current board member, I have the experience and leadership that is vital, given the current level of experience on the board. No other candidate understands Maryland school policy and legislation better than myself. I currently serve on the Board of Directors for the Maryland Association of Boards of Education, which advocates for the autonomy of local school boards. I have devoted thousands of hours to help our school system working closely with community leaders. I retired after 38 years working for the Navy as an engineer and branch head. I comprehend large budgets, think analytically and can align processes with goals. I pride myself on working with other people and as a branch head received the Command Diversity Award for my efforts in hiring. My wife is an educator (Charles County Public Schools and College of Southern Maryland) and our son is a Charles County Public Schools graduate. I am involved in numerous community organizations and desire to incorporate these nonprofits to help our school system continue to move in a positive direction. I have lived my entire life in the DMV, the past 30 years in Charles County, so I know the culture and the values of the people I represent. ","<p>The most important issue is student achievement, which was greatly affected by COVID. No board can guarantee achievement, but a board must establish the framework for student success.
<p>The elected board is responsible for three primary items: Formulating and delivering a budget, choosing a superintendent and developing policy. These facets are connected and form the framework for success.
<p>Obtaining necessary resources (via the budget) to educate children is our immediate issue. Our most recent budget was underfunded by $17 million! The percentage of the budget the school system receives relative to the total county budget has DECREASED steadily over the past five years. This is unacceptable. I will continue to make our commissioners (our local funding source) aware of what is not occurring due to a lack of funding. Parents want us to do more, but we are limited because of resources.
<p>A superintendent must share the vision of the board and set high standards for student achievement.  I will vote for a superintendent who prioritizes student success and achievement consistent with the priorities of the board.
<p>Policy must be equitable to ensure resources reach the students who need it most. I will ensure that policies direct resources to our most vulnerable students to increase their prospect for success.
<p>I have strongly advocated for academic and social/emotional resources and programs and will continue to do so. Parental and community involvement is critical and I helped to establish a program that recognizes our volunteers across the county.
","Steve Jobs. As an engineer, I admire his tenacity and desire to make the world a better place. He left us too soon. Oprah Winfrey. Her work ethic and philanthropic endeavors speak for themselves. She came from a less-than-ideal childhood and captured the American dream.
","<p>Though not perfect, I support the Blueprint. Your ZIP code or household income should not define the quality of your education. The Blueprint has a dramatic impact on the services provided to Charles County Public Schools students.
<p>Pre-kindergarten, including 3-year-old programs, will be available to more children. Quality pre-kindergarten is a game-changer for many parents and will prepare students for kindergarten and lay the foundation for a brighter future.
<p>Increasing teacher pay and the additional stipends will help attract the best and motivated educators.  It’s no secret that teacher pay lags behind many other professions that require a college degree. There is a teacher shortage across the country, and this will help with recruitment and retainment.
<p>The Blueprint provides for expanded Career and Technology Education programs which will provide certifications enabling high school graduates to enter the workforce at a higher salary.
<p>Students in concentrated areas of poverty will be part of a Community School, which has a dedicated director to provide additional wrap-around services to students. English language learners will also receive additional resources to increase their proficiency.
<p>There are three categories of students (here and across the country) that have historically been underserved and hence have not experienced the academic success of their peers. These are children in poverty, English language 
learners and special education students. Charles County Public Schools has experienced a significant increase in all of these students in the past 10 years. The Blueprint addresses this, but it will take time and funding to achieve meaningful results.
","There is no reason for students to be using their phones during class. I support this and current Charles County Public Schools policy reflects this. In middle school, phones cannot be used at all during the school day and must be turned off. In high school, they are allowed at lunch and certain activity times but must remain off at all other times. No photos or videos are ever allowed during school. Cellphone use is a huge disruption and interferes with teaching. The policy allows a student to have a phone (for emergencies or after school use), but again it cannot be on during class. Every student is provided a laptop and internet access so a phone is not necessary in order to access the internet or to do work. Administrators need to enforce this policy to minimize disruptions during class.","Yes, but we need to remain proactive. Charles County Public Schools have made significant investments in school safety and security. Camera and guided vestibules guide visitors through the front office, and visitors need to show identification. There is a director of school safety and security who has implemented systems and protocols to protect students and staff from people who do not belong in the school. The majority of incidents between students stem from activity outside of school. School resource officers monitor social media to intervene before serious actions occur. There is a “see something, say something” program that alerts school officials. Additional training for teachers and staff is given to identify and de-escalate situations between students. Youth Engagement Advocates have been established to work with students who are not receiving appropriate support outside of school.  Community members are encouraged to contact the school with any information they feel can be helpful.","I am not the “thought police.”  Recent Maryland law speaks to school library books, and as an elected official, I uphold the law. Books must meet standards for school libraries as defined in the Code of Maryland Regulations. It also requires each school system to develop policy and procedures to review objections to materials in a school library media program. The board does not and should not review every library book prior to its placement but can review objections in accordance with the law. New textbooks (new textbooks are approved by the board) are submitted by the superintendent through a selection committee comprised of Charles County Public Schools staff, parents and/or students. The public is always given an opportunity to review and comment on new textbooks before the board votes.

",I have a doctoral degree in education leadership from Northcentral University. ,"I am running for the school board to enhance the education of children and students, build and strengthen our community, bridge the gap between early childcare and school-age children, and most importantly, because I believe in quality education for all children and students. ",I believe a good candidate for this position must be willing to always walk in good character and integrity at all times. The candidate must be able to identify the problems within childcare and our school systems and produce solutions with the assistance of all parties involved. The candidate must also diligently serve the people of our community by involving them every step of the way when making decisions for our children and our students. ,"The most important issue that I would like to face is ensuring that our children are provided with the best education possible in childcare centers and in our school system. Additionally, I would like to discuss different options for children and our school-age students to receive individual learning assistance and tutoring to enhance their learning where they may fall short. I relocated to St. Charles to make sure my own children attended the best schools over 14 years ago, and during my campaign, I have heard the cries of our parents insisting that a change is made concerning education in Charles County. ","I admire my late Apostle Betty Bigesby. She assisted in different ministries, trained pastors, led many community groups in developing and training leaders. Her heart was for children, youth and young adults, and she was committed to helping them to identify their gifts and talents at an early age. She believed in young entrepreneurship, and she was a wonderful example of a public leader who made a difference in the lives of everyone she met. She changed the atmosphere in every room she walked into, and she taught the importance of education and the difference it makes. ","I feel that the Blueprint is necessary to assist with funding our early childcare programs especially when there are so many children with so many different needs. This includes mental health and providing our parents with the tools, strategies and resources needed outside of their homes. In addition, there is a strong need to keep our teachers from teacher burnout by providing them with professional development and additional support where needed and most of all, increased teacher starting pay to help them feel valued as educators. As a school board member, it is important to be in the trenches and not just on the sidelines. For example, there are many parents who need advocates to help them support their children with disabilities by attending Individualized Education Plan meetings and explaining how we will support them through the process. This assistance is needed in early learning centers as well as in the school systems. I plan to include teachers, staff, parents, children, students and our community from all districts to assist in the process and with making the necessary changes that are needed in our education system. ","Technology is very prevalent in the education system today. I remember one of my students pulling out his cellphone to take a picture years ago. I asked what he was doing, and he said, “I am taking a picture of the homework, Ms. Smalls.” He smiled, and I honestly didn't make a big deal out of it because I knew it worked for him. Each student is different, and each student learns differently. I think cellphones can be used to educate students in the classrooms with a strict cellphone usage policy enforced by the teachers who allow the children to use them. I also believe the students and parents must be involved in the process and they must stick to the guidelines. Providing a contract with the policies and procedures of using the cellphone to the students and their parents would also be necessary. ","I believe that all staff, teachers, children and students should be provided with training from proficient and qualified emergency trainers to prepare them for emergency situations. I also believe emergency equipment and strategies must be provided to all centers and schools to ensure that we are prepared for the unknown. I believe parents should be included in the training also to know what will take place in their child's center or school in case of an emergency. We must review and recognize all of the past events that have occurred and see what could have been done to prevent the incident(s) in order to keep us prepared and to keep us all safe at all times in the future. ","I think books should be reviewed before being placed in child care centers and school libraries. It is the responsibility of us all to know what books are acceptable and not acceptable for our children and our students. Words are powerful, and they can make a difference in the lives of our children and students. I would not want a child or student to read a book that would wrongly influence their decision(s) or cause them to act out due to something they have read from a book. ",It is my opinion that policies and procedures are in place to prevent incidents and accidents from happening. I feel that the most important thing is that our children and students are provided with the best education possible.

","Master’s of business administration, Johns Hopkins University.

","<p>In 2023, I had the honor of being appointed by the Dorchester County Council to complete the remainder of an open term, which runs through December 2024. I have enjoyed the work of the board and earned accolades from parents, teachers and students for organized, empathetic leadership, and thoughtful questions to each issue that comes before the board for consideration and action.  
<p>After one year of service and learning lots of what it takes to add value as a board member, and with the encouragement of family and friends, I decided to submit my name for election by the voters of District 5 to continue my service for a full term.
<p>Throughout my career I have been able to stay close to education through direct work with national education innovators, as well as volunteering with Junior Achievement. I was able to work to gain philanthropic support totaling over $2 million for them nationally and served on the board for the Eastern Shore from 2019-23. I was also able to raise over $20,000 for charities supporting young people with special needs, led the conversion of Moving Dorchester Forward to one of the leading nonprofit entities in the area, as well as served as the co-lead for the Campaign for Grade-Level Reading for Dorchester County. I also led the Education Committee of the Dorchester Chamber from 2020-23 to help connect our business community to the educational system in ways that make real impact for our community.
<p>Some of the key impacts that I have been able to add to the Board as the appointed member representing District 5 include collaboration and development of: A monthly publicly available Data Dashboard capturing what is most important to the board and community in a clear and actionable way; Clearer connections to the business community and elevation of the new supports and resources associated with the Blueprint Career and College Readiness priority area; and a reinstated Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education (CASE) agricultural program at Dorchester Career & Technology Center to ensure that exposure to pathways to success in agriculture remain a viable part of the educational experience for students in our community. 
<p>I am committed to collaboration with all members of our community, educational excellence for our students and helping to create the conditions for growth in our community. My experience, skills, passion and transformative impact make me a compelling Board of Education candidate, poised to continue to meaningfully contribute to Dorchester County. ","<p>I have had a career intersecting business and education. I spent 15 years in the consumer products industry with Nabisco, Kraft and Pepsi in sales, management and national leadership positions. In the second half of my career, I was able to leverage the training and experience I gained at those international corporations to get back to education as an executive at Edison Schools and Sylvan Learning, leading their online division nationally. I also led Corporate and Community Partnerships for University of Maryland as well as Purdue University in the startup of Purdue Global. All of those experiences led to a number of consulting opportunities that I turned into a full-time business in 2016. I have worked since then with a variety of organizations across the country to help them build foundations and improve processes leading to positive growth and impact.
<p>This has kept me close to education innovations, as well as in collaborations to help education, business and the community working together toward common goals. I have found opportunities to help all stakeholders find common ground towards collective action. 
<p>I have also learned that the role of the board is to help bring together the 'what' and the 'why' of the district, while empowering the district leadership and educators to lead the 'how', without getting in their way. ","<p>I believe that there are three key priorities for us as a school board to help the community navigate. They include: 
<p>Put students first
<p>There is a lot that goes into this. This includes making sure our students are safe, the culture and conditions for learning are the continuous goal, and the well-being of our students is paramount. The board and district leadership have worked to implement a comprehensive strategy of collaboration with law enforcement, staff and community stakeholders. We regularly work together to address and mitigate potential threats, creating a secure learning environment where students can thrive without compromise. 
<p>Give educators the tools they need.
<p>While there are real budgetary constraints that school districts regularly are challenged to balance, there are opportunities for us to engage and listen to educators share what they need to be able to thrive in their important roles of helping create the conditions for our students to grow. Professional support and compensation, continued education and development, and the best resources that we can supply for them to do their jobs are basic foundations that our educators should be able to expect. Real and consistent collaboration that enables them to share and be heard, and more importantly, see action and outcomes are critical to giving educators what they need. Educators include teachers AND every trusted adult in our community that are part of the pathways to success for our students – we need ALL who want to be part of that to get involved. 
<p>Get the entire community involved.
<p>Students need to know what is available to them outside of school. Whether they want to choose a career right out of school or additional education, it is an important part of our role as educators and members of the community surrounding them to help students find the pathways to success for them. This requires engagement, collaboration, and clear communication with all members of our community including businesses, organizations, and supports that are available to our students. Apprenticeships are finally being seen as the solutions that they can be for young people to explore and learn what sparks them and helps them to figure out their best path. This also helps develop the talent pipeline for our local businesses to thrive.","<p>I personally think that we put too much emphasis on specific individuals that we admire and then unfortunately draw conclusions about an individual based on who they list and their various opinions about them. I am more comfortable naming leadership qualities that I admire and that I aspire to in my work on the school board. I admire and appreciate leaders who listen, take in all facts that they can gather, engage with all stakeholders possible and then make decisions that bring all the best thoughts and solutions possible together. 
<p>In my opinion, none of the work that we do on the school board should come down to individuals and specific agendas and biases that they may have. It is a collective effort of the individuals that comprise the board with a full sharing of information, collaborative discussion and conclusions that represent the individuals as well as those they represent.","<p>I believe in all the premises and intended outcomes for the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. To have a clear direction toward a vision and mission that will get us to breakthrough results in these key areas is a good and strong expectation to set, and there clearly were a lot of research-based priorities that were set forth in the Blueprint.
<p>The challenges now are in the practical application of seeing those goals and objectives implemented. There are significant obstacles that exist in the way that it is structured for stakeholders who want to participate, to be able to engage and support the plans. Partners in early childhood education that have the best practices and the means to support are confused and see requirements of the plan that impede their ability to participate. Likewise, the funding models and expectations for funding collaboration at the county level have actually pitted agencies against each other in ways that they do not wish to be opposed, but the expectations put them at odds without guidance and clarity as to the original intent and with solutions to how to move forward. 
<p>I would like to see collaborative solutions that enable us to collectively move forward toward actionable plans and am committed to doing my part as a board member to helping that happen.","<p>I fully support the current approach of our school district which is to take all the latest best practices and pilot them during this school year to see the various impacts of multiple approaches. This will enable all stakeholders to educate ourselves, have collaborative discussions throughout the year and culminate in a recommendation from the superintendent and the district leadership team in the spring of 2025, which the board will be able to discuss, question and find the best solutions for our community.
<p>I will support the policy that best supports the academic environment of learning for our students. Our job is to help create the conditions for all students to learn and thrive.","I am satisfied with our efforts. We have developed over the course of the last year a districtwide School Safety Plan, elevated a key leader with a strong background in that area, invested in technologies aligned to the needs of different school levels and personalities and instituted a system focused on data-driven decision making and continuous review and improvement.","<p>I believe that students should have access to age-appropriate peer and community reviewed books in our libraries. The district has policies and processes in place to ensure that there is regular review and approval from a cross-section of our school communities for all curricula, books and learning materials. With each approval that is asked of us as a board, my main questions (if not already answered) are 1) Have we followed our policy and procedures for this recommendation to make it to the board?, and 2) Who was on the group that completed the review?
<p>I support any parent or community stakeholder being able to raise questions or concerns that they may have, and that our policies and procedures are consistently followed with any review. The only time circumstances that I would support is if a recommendation came to us to make a change that has gone through that comprehensive process.","<p>I believe school districts and school boards have a responsibility to work together to create the best conditions for all students to thrive. That means a lot of different things to different students and their communities. I am personally most focused on ensuring as a board member that we are clear and consistent with both our policies and the application of them. I have not seen any specific examples that match what you describe in your question and have not developed a full opinion of such policies as a result. 
<p>I believe in continuous growth and learning, and this drives a curiosity to learn more and develop more of an informed opinion about it. At the same time, there have been no questions that have come before me with this question and I would need to consider all the variables in front of me in order to develop an opinion or come to a conclusion on a question before us as a board.

Frederick County,Colt Morningstar Black,y,www.coltblack.com,null,electcoltblack2022@gmail.com,36,"Owner and supervising mortician, Black's Funeral Home & Acacia Society; co-owner- BlueStar EMS Corp.","Associate's degree,  American Academy McAllister Institute of Funeral Service.","I am running to restore balance and sanity back to the school board of Frederick County. We are currently facing a major budget crunch. Without proper funding, schools can't operate. Tough decisions must be made to stabilize our financial standing and move forward. Our learning environment for students and work environment for staff must be welcome to all but without infringing on the rights of others to do so. In general, our current board members have enacted policies which create hostile learning and work environments to numerous individuals’ rights of free thought and expression. We must end the madness.  ","I am a father of three Frederick County Public Schools students, a lifelong Frederick County resident and business owner. In my line of work both as a funeral director and as an emergency medical technician, I manage crises every day, which is exactly the situation facing our schools. I am adept at giving accurate information even when it's bad and finding unconventional solutions to problems that arise. As a father, I talk to my kids, their friends and their friends' parents, among others. I have my finger on the pulse of the community and its expectations for the school system.","One of the most important issues facing the school board is the lack of transparency of the school system to parents. From day one I will work to eliminate policies that place barriers between parents, educators, administration and students within the school system while enacting policies to enhance communication between all stakeholders. There is no room for deception, withholding or lying to our students, parents or the community at large. Under my leadership, I promise to be the most transparent member of the Board of Education. ",Thomas Jefferson would be a public leader I admire. Thomas Jefferson was a visionary who believed in the cause of liberty and freedom guaranteed by our Constitution. He was a studied scholar who understood the importance of education. ,"I firmly believe the Blueprint for Maryland's Future is an overzealous plan to artificially create winners and losers. While working to resolve inequity in education, it will in turn create weakened schools that  were not weak prior to the implementation of the Blueprint. It will cost the taxpayer dearly without making a difference in the outcomes. Throwing money at our education issues is not the cure. And the metrics being used to determine college/career readiness (i.e. standardized test) prove nothing. Until teachers stop the cycle of ""teaching to the test,"" our students will continue to falter. ","As a parent I send my kids to school with their phone to contact myself or my wife, a trusted friend or authorities in case of emergency. While I understand the implications educationally and mentally, I would never be in favor of disallowing cellphones in school altogether. My policy would allow students to retain their phones at school. I would require a modified do not disturb setting be enabled to prevent neverending notifications or other distractions from going off. During testing, the phones could be placed into some sort of storage bin in each classroom. ","If elected, I will work to have a systemwide security and safety audit conducted. I would insist that all changes be based upon the framework. I strongly support armed school security for every school campus in Frederick County.","I am a First Amendment absolutist, so in short, I don't support book bans. However it is reasonable to not use tax dollars to purchase books for school libraries which hold no academic, historical or social value. And age-appropriateness is a factor, as well. Once someone is no longer in school, it's up to parents to police what their children are consuming, but overall school systems should work to ensure materials are age-appropriate, and what may be all right for a high school-age student would not be all right for a middle or elementary school student. Books which contain extreme violence or are sexually explicit, which glorify these things with no academic value, should be removed. All books, both instructional and library resources, should be reviewed by a committee and public comment accepted before allowing them or disallowing them in the educational setting.","These policies are an absolute breach of parental and public confidence in the schools. When children are struggling, be it with physical, mental or learning issues in school, it is the absolute responsibility of the school to inform the parents so the student can receive help. Gender issues are no different. How can a parent get a student help if they don't know something is amiss? Any policy that keeps parents from their children is the wrong policy and must be eliminated. "

",Bachelor’s degree from the College of Notre Dame of Maryland. ,"I am running because I believe our system is at a tipping point. We have strayed too far away from the mission, which is providing a high- quality education to every child, and we have lost focus on producing students who have the tools to go out into the world and be successful. Our test scores are abysmal and falling. Our budget is exploding. Our children have never recovered from COVID lockdowns. We are going in the wrong direction,, and if we do not reset the course, we may not ever be able to recover. Our kids need solid evidence-based proven curriculum; they need options of schools that will meet their needs and support their learning styles; we need to expand and update our Career and Technology Center so we can accommodate all the kids who will want to attend, as well as make sure we can accommodate space in our other programs like the International Baccalaureate program and the Early College Program. We spend far too much money to have such terrible academic results and lack of space in our specialized programs. Additionally, our schools are increasingly unsafe, teachers report students are increasingly unruly, and our teachers are not provided the resources or supports to effectively manage their students, creating learning loss and disruptions as well as significant safety issues. It’s time for a change. ","I have actually helped run one of the top public charter schools in this state. I have helped make all the decisions as a Board of Trustees member or Frederick Classical Charter School that I will be asked to make as a Board of Education member for Frederick County Public Schools. I know what works and what doesn’t work. I know how to do more with less, since charters receive between 75% and 85% of the funding of their district counterparts. It is possible to provide an education where the vast majority of the students are meeting or exceeding expectations, but it requires solid curriculum, skilled educators and an entire system devoted to academic achievement. I also have extensive business and management experience. And we absolutely need to get this budget under control. Our system asked for almost a billion dollars last year, but they provide very little detailed information on what they spend the money on. We need to attack that budget with a fine-toothed comb. I understand budgeting, business and management in ways no other candidate does, and believe those skills will be useful in the management of the system. I am also a mom and care deeply about the education and what is happening to our children. Our kids are not OK. We have a system that is not meeting their needs, and we need to work to fix that. ","<p>There is not just one most important issue. The two most important issues are the poor performance of our students and our budget. This is not just the performance on standardized tests. It is about the disruptions in the classroom, the discipline issues, the fights and the elopements (the early departure of a student during the school day) that occur in some schools more than once every day. Our kids cannot learn in chaos. Our current discipline policy and the lack of proper staffing for our special needs students compounds this issue because teachers and students are not given the support they need. That is in addition to the ineffective curriculum we use. 
<p>Additionally,  our budget is out of control. I do not believe we have been good stewards of the funds we have been provided, and we need people who will make sure we are using those funds as efficiently as possible. If elected, I will work with administration to implement a more consistent discipline program to make sure that we are using all the tools that we have available to manage our classrooms. I would also make sure that we invest heavily in our special needs students, their teachers and the supports they need to successfully manage their classrooms. Our train-the-trainer approach to special needs educator training has not been effective and created gaps in skills and abilities. We will also need to evaluate and implement new curriculums as well as take a deep dive into the budget.","Honestly, I am not into the idea of putting other people on pedestals. I think some people show courage and fortitude in some ways and fail dramatically at other times. However, I do very much like the writings of Dr. Thomas Sowell, as I believe he is able to cut through the current politically correct jargon of the day and get right to the heart of the matter, particularly when he is opining on our education system. ","The only effect the Blueprint will have on our district is a negative impact. While I support increasing teacher salaries in general, that is about the only thing that is remotely workable, achievable or beneficial. There is nothing in the Blueprint that will actually improve student performance, and it is designed to take money from districts and schools that are doing well and transfer it to schools that are not, when the issues at those schools cannot be solved by just spending more money on them. As we are seeing Howard County, this results in things like eliminating gifted-and-talented classes, etc. It also will result in nothing but bloated administration costs as we pad administration positions to provide advancement opportunities. I support paying our seasoned educators well. I support providing them opportunities to mentor and train new staff.  But no successful enterprise creates more top-level bureaucracy just to provide promotions. That is a recipe for disaster. We see more and more people and counties backing away from this. Gov. Wes Moore himself is clearly starting to see the writing on the wall and has recently begun to signal that they may need to go back to the drawing board on some aspects of the Blueprint. ","Cellphones are a huge distraction. We had a policy at our charter school (K-8) of no cellphones during school hours, and that worked well. I think a similar policy should be used systemwide for those grades.   Kids could use them before school or after dismissal, but during the day phones were to be off and in bookbags. If a student was caught with the phone out during the day, the phone would be taken, and the parent would have to come and check it out of the office. There were escalating actions based on continued infractions, but they didn’t have to use those too often. For grades 9-12, use of phones at lunch would be acceptable, as many kids have after-school responsibilities that they may need to address. But I think otherwise they should be off and out of sight the rest of the day as well. ","I am satisfied with the safety for the big, catastrophic-type events. But I am not satisfied with the daily acts of violence, fights and elopements that occur. I think that expanding the school resource officer program so that we have a designated SRO in each middle and high school would help. We also need better training on de-escalation and better training on proper restraint procedures. Our district is under a consent decree with the Department of Justice because school officials improperly restrained and excluded special needs students. However, because of that they have gone too far in the other direction. They need to invest in the personnel and the training necessary to do things correctly for the safety of all the students and teachers involved.  ","Yes, our school libraries should not contain pervasively vulgar or sexually explicit books. Parents have controls on the internet, on Netflix, etc. to protect their kids from that material and they have every reason to assume their students won’t be able to access that stuff at school. My rule of thumb is: If it were a movie, would it be R or worse? If so, then it should not be available to kids under 17, just like they couldn’t go see it at the movies. I don’t see why our school libraries would contain that kind of material in the first place, so I don’t see why these items would have to be “removed”. What kind of adult exposes a minor to R-rated content on purpose? But I certainly also think that parents and concerned community members should be able to challenge items that they find in the school.","Those policies are absolutely a violation of parental rights, and no school should have them. Social transition is a powerful therapy tool and should not be used outside of the advice or care of a qualified therapist. Our schools should not be practicing psychology without a license on our students. We are seeing districts across the country be sued for policies like this, and I think it is only a matter of time before they are subject to huge judgments, not to mention the defense costs for these bad policies. Our schools are mandatory reporters. If a child reports that they are afraid of a parent for any reason, we are obligated to report that to the appropriate authorities, and then we should let them handle it. It is not the place of our unqualified staff to get into the middle between a parent and their child. "

<p>For more detailed information, please visit my website: www.veronicaloweforfrederickcountypublicschoolsbo.com/","<p>One of the most important issues facing our school board is addressing teacher retention and recruitment, as well as the broader challenge of adequately funding the budget to meet the needs of our schools. 
<p>In today’s competitive environment, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to attract and retain high-quality, diverse educators, which directly impacts the quality of education our students receive. Teacher shortages, burnout and increased demands on educators are contributing to this issue, alongside budget constraints that limit our ability to fully support them. 
<p>I would also prioritize addressing working conditions, including class sizes, resources, and administrative support, to ensure that teachers can focus on what they do best: teaching.
<p>If elected, I would focus on creating a supportive environment for educators, ensuring they feel valued and supported. This includes advocating for competitive salaries, benefits and professional development opportunities, along with building mentorship programs for new teachers. 
<p>We must also address working conditions, such as reducing class sizes and providing adequate resources, to enable teachers to focus on their core mission: educating students.
<p>In terms of budget, I would work to ensure we have the funding necessary to meet these needs, advocating for sustainable sources of financial support while maximizing the efficiency of our current budget. Building capacity within our staff and administration is also essential to ensure long-term success.
<p>Safety is another key concern. I would advocate for improving security measures while fostering a safe, welcoming environment for students and staff. This includes mental health resources and ensuring that safety protocols are in place and effective.
<p>Addressing these issues will help create a stronger, more supportive educational environment for students and staff alike.","<p>I admire Michelle Obama for her leadership, grace and dedication to improving the lives of others.

<p>Her famous words, ""When they go low, we go high,"" and her call to ""Do something"" at the Democratic Convention, resonates deeply and serve as powerful reminders to rise above negativity and take action to make a difference. 
<p>Michelle Obama’s focus on education, health and equality reflects a deep commitment to creating opportunities for all, and her leadership is both compassionate and empowering. She continues to lead with integrity, staying true to her values and serving as a strong voice for positive change.","<p>The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future represents a transformative investment in our education system, and I fully support its goals. I believe the Blueprint is a great plan; however, I have concerns about the availability of sufficient funding to support its full implementation over the 10-year period. While increased funding for early childhood education is crucial for reducing achievement gaps, we must ensure that the financial resources are available to sustain these initiatives long-term.
<p>Raising teacher starting pay is another essential component. Competitive salaries and livable wages are key to attracting and retaining high-quality, diverse educators. While our district will benefit from offering fair compensation, without guaranteed funding, this aspect of the Blueprint may face significant challenges.
<p>The Blueprint’s focus on college and career readiness ensures that students graduate with the skills they need to succeed, whether they pursue higher education or enter the workforce. The expanded services for multilingual and impoverished families promote equity in education and create pathways to success for all students. However, without secure funding, these critical initiatives may be jeopardized.
<p>To fully realize the Blueprint’s potential, we must secure sustainable funding sources. As a board member, I would advocate for long-term financial support while seeking creative solutions to maximize available resources.

While cellphones can be a distraction that impacts focus and learning, they are also vital for safety. A balanced policy should address the importance of education while recognizing the practical needs of students in today's digital world, promoting both responsibility and safety.","<p>While I appreciate the steps our district has taken to ensure student safety, I believe we can always do more. We need to prioritize better communication between schools and families, and ensure staff receive ongoing safety training. Mental health resources are crucial, and we should focus on expanding support to help identify and address issues early. 
<p>We need to continue strengthening our partnerships with local law enforcement and increase the presence of security personnel where needed. It's also important to ensure that school resource officers working with our students have the right temperament to foster a safe and supportive environment without making schools feel unwelcoming. 
<p>Additionally, upgrading security technology, such as surveillance systems and emergency alerts, would be a smart investment. Ultimately, we need to collaborate with students, parents, staff and the community to stay ahead of potential safety concerns and ensure our schools are as safe as possible.","<p>Yes, I believe there are circumstances where books should be reviewed and, if necessary, removed from school libraries, particularly if they contain content that is clearly inappropriate and not suitable for the age group.
<p>However, this should not be done arbitrarily; it should be handled thoughtfully and transparently. Decisions about removing books should follow the current Board Policy 500, which involves a diverse review committee that includes educators, parents, students, administrators and community members. 
<p>This ensures that books are evaluated fairly and with consideration of both educational value and the community's values. It is important to strike a balance between protecting students from harmful content and maintaining access to diverse perspectives and ideas that foster critical thinking and personal growth.","<p>I support Frederick County Public Schools Policy 443 (which aims to create welcoming and affirming schools for transgender and gender nonconforming students).. I believe that every student deserves a safe and supportive environment at school, including the use of their preferred pronouns. 
<p>However, the relationship between schools and parents is critical, and transparency is key to building trust. While it’s important to respect students' identities, schools should also strive to engage parents in a way that is sensitive to each student's needs and safety. If a student feels uncomfortable discussing their gender identity with their family, schools should provide appropriate support and resources, while encouraging open communication when it is safe to do so. 
<p>Ultimately, policies should prioritize the well-being of students, balancing their privacy and safety with parental involvement in a thoughtful and respectful manner."

","<p>I am running to provide students with an education that prepares them to impact the world positively. By creating an inclusive and diverse learning environment, we can build a better future for all. I want to prioritize enriching academics and supporting mental health over censoring books or violating students' privacy by creating an environment that celebrates each student's unique abilities.
<p>I want to advocate for the necessary investments to address overcrowding. As the fastest-growing county in Maryland, it's crucial to advocate for funding for building improvements and ensure that our schools have the space to accommodate all students. Transparency is critical in our community engagement so all stakeholders can voice their opinions.
<p>I'm dedicated to supporting educators in delivering quality education to every student by creating an environment that fosters academic achievement while ensuring educators feel respected and valued as experts in their field. Respecting educators' autonomy and facilitating relationship-building to enhance academic achievement is crucial.
<p>I am determined to create an education system in Frederick that allows educators to work and teach in their communities, focusing on student achievement. I aim to attract diverse educators by providing fair compensation, time, and trust.
<p>Special education programs must be fully staffed and equipped to provide high-quality education to students with special needs. We must unlock their potential, support their parents, and build trust in our school communities.
<p>I am running to create an education system that empowers students and educators alike to achieve their full potential.","<p>I am a strong candidate for the Board of Education with 18 years of experience as an educator, coach, union leader and activist. I am dedicated to providing inclusive and diverse education for all students, especially in special education programs. I advocate for students, educators, and communities on various levels, addressing issues such as learning environments, special education services and recruitment of diverse educators. My ability to communicate with diverse stakeholders allows me to be an effective educational activist, ensuring that all voices are heard.
<p>In addition to my advocacy work, I have gained valuable negotiation experience. I have served on three impact negotiation teams focused on student and staff safety and protection. This experience has given me a deep understanding of the concerns of the community, parents and educators. I am confident in my ability to navigate complex issues, always keeping the best interests of our students, communities,  and educators at the forefront.
<p>As a high school football and track coach, I have had the opportunity to lead, mentor and support students and their families. I have volunteered as a youth coach and mentor in the Frederick community, offering athletic and academic guidance to students. I understand the importance of positive mentorship for children and have always valued this aspect of my work.

<p>Most importantly, I parent two elementary school children in the Frederick County Public Schools system. My perspective as a parent, educator and community member makes me well-suited for the Board of Education member role in Frederick.","<p>One critical issue is special education. I advocate for genuinely inclusive education, which means that students with disabilities should have programs that support their needs inside their home schools. When the school community integrates students with disabilities with appropriate institutional support, it benefits the students and changes attitudes and behaviors in the community. True inclusion also means that we are always looking for the least restrictive environment for our students to gain academic and social success.
<p>I strongly advocate for a fully funded special education program that can cater to the diverse learning needs of all students within Frederick County Public Schools. I will urge the Board of Education to implement programs aligned with a student's Individual Education Plan and that are available in the schools. Special education students deserve the best service, and I am committed to ensuring they receive it. 
<p>I will also look into the staffing formula for special education and hire professionals based on the needs of these students. I will listen to our professionals to determine manageable and appropriate caseloads for each program. This policy will ensure that educators can implement Individual Education Plans accurately and with complete support and have adequate time to do so. We will provide professional pay to support staff and teachers to ensure quality education for our most vulnerable students.","I greatly admire John Lewis for his lifelong dedication to fighting for civil rights and his unwavering commitment to justice and equality. From a young age, he saw the unfairness of segregation, and instead of accepting it, he dedicated his life to making a change. Despite the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, which was supposed to end racial segregation in schools, he realized that it did not change his own schooling experience. He showed bravery and dedication, and fearlessly got into ""Good Trouble"" during the civil rights movement to do what he felt was right for himself and for future generations. His willingness to endure violence during the marches from Selma to Montgomery, and his continued advocacy for social and legal change until his passing, are truly remarkable to me. He had a profound impact on many like myself.","<p>I am a big supporter of the Blueprint. I will say that we also have to push our local governments to invest their share. Public education has been consistently underfunded throughout history, and the Blueprint acknowledges that and is a step toward funding public education appropriately. As a rapidly expanding county in Maryland, Frederick must urgently step up and advocate for funding to enhance our education system. The need for more funding from the state to promptly support the implementation of the Blueprint is pressing. Enhancement of the minimum salary of $60,000 for teachers is needed now, along with universal pre-kindergarten, upgrades to special education programs, and, for the fastest-growing county in Maryland, a funded public school system.
<p>Maryland's promise to invest $3.9 billion in public schools is a beacon of hope for us. This investment has the potential to revolutionize our education system and shape a brighter future for our students. 
<p>The success of our students and the future of our community are not just at stake, but they depend entirely on the quality of education we provide. This investment will focus on early childhood education, teacher diversity and quality, college and career readiness, providing more resources to needy students, and accountability. ","During school hours, cellphones should not be used. Studies have shown the negative impact of cellphone use on academic performance, social-emotional development and mental health. Although I recognize the pervasive nature of cellphones in our society, as an educator, I understand the difficulty of maintaining a focused learning environment when cellphones are present. Additionally, safety concerns such as bullying, recording of fights and unauthorized entry into school premises through messaging are important considerations. I believe that school cellphone policies should prioritize safety measures for the well-being of the students.","<p>I believe we can always do better. We need to have clear and definitive consequences for bullying students who are members of vulnerable populations. We should provide wrap-around services for all students, including those who are struggling with mental health issues or experiencing discrimination. 
<p>To make schools safer for vulnerable populations, we must create a welcoming and inclusive environment that values diversity. This involves promoting cultural awareness and sensitivity, implementing anti-bullying policies and providing support services for students struggling with mental health issues or discrimination. Collaboration with community organizations can also offer access to resources such as counseling, mentorship and after-school programs. It's a multi-faceted approach that requires a collective commitment from educators, administrators, students and the broader community. Hiring unarmed security professionals and enforcing clear consequences for bullying are crucial steps toward ensuring a safe school environment for all students.","<p>I oppose book banning and believe a book should only be relocated if it is not on the appropriate grade-level content and subsequently relocated to the appropriate grade level for students. Even then, I oppose the reasoning presented by groups like Moms for Liberty for banning books. 
<p>Understanding the reasons behind such an attempt and assessing the potential impact on the students and the community is essential. Engaging in open and respectful dialogue with all parties involved, including school administrators, teachers, parents and students, is also necessary. A group should make those decisions with all stakeholders involved, and that diverse group should make decisions. Advocating for the freedom of expression and the right to access diverse perspectives and ideas is vital to promoting a healthy and inclusive learning environment.

<p>We should all stay informed by joining advocacy groups and participating in relevant public forums which can help raise awareness and support for maintaining a robust and inclusive curriculum. 
Frederick County has a program that gives parents the right to restrict their children from reading books without infringing on the rights of other parents. That is an essential step in stopping the banning of books. I will be a voice to ensure that the reasoning for banning isn't to silence diversity, inclusion, LGBTQIA+, etc.
","<p>I am committed to implementing and maintaining Policy 443, which aims to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students and safeguard their right to express themselves with their preferred names and pronouns.
<p>Providing a safe, inclusive and welcoming learning environment aligns with my moral values as an educator. Schools should foster a safe environment for all students, physically, emotionally and academically. We should protect students' right to express themselves with their preferred names and pronouns.
<p>Research has shown that the consistent use of a child's affirmed name can reduce suicidal ideation by 29% and suicidal behaviors by 56%t. Using preferred names is imperative to help save our students. Resources such as clothing, name badges and celebrating LGBTQIA+ contributions to science, math, medicine, literature, art and technology in the United States can be helpful strategies.
<p>I aim to protect students' rights while at school."

His passion to help is evident in most everything he does.,The ideas and solutions presented by the Blueprint come with an awful lot of obstacles.  Those of us in rural and somewhat low-income areas will have difficulty meeting all the guarantees and expectations of the Blueprint.

Security vestibules, school security officers, background checks for visitors, instant communication systems, etc., go a long way in protecting all who are associated with Garrett County Public Schools.","Inappropriate books certainly should not be available to students. However, the decision as to what is inappropriate is a very slippery slope. As a former teacher, I trust the decisions made by teachers, librarians, central office staff and school administrators with regard to appropriate materials.

",I decided to run for the Board of Education because I want to serve the community by improving our public schools. My goal is to provide all students with the best education for their future and to recruit and retain the best teachers and staff.,"My major qualifications include being an engaged parent with three children who attended Howard County Public Schools; a high achiever in education with Ph.D.s in physics and economics; an experienced financial industry manager, uniquely equipped to address school budget management issues; a proven problem solver throughout my career; a patient listener and go-getter, known by colleagues, friends, and neighbors in the community; and an accountable leader both at work and in the community.","Accountability is the most critical issue facing my school board. The board must be accountable for providing a long-term budget that avoids shortfalls and the need for teacher cuts, ensuring capital improvements to address issues like mold and safety concerns in schools, maintaining healthy school meals free from widespread spoilage, and delivering an education system that does not leave nearly 60% of students without math proficiency and nearly 40% without English language arts proficiency. If elected, I will ensure that the board is accountable for all our actions, thereby holding the superintendent accountable for the operation of the school system.","One person I admire is Professor T.D. Lee of Columbia University, who passed away this August. He studied physics, earned a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and received the Nobel Prize in 1957 as the second youngest recipient. He was also the youngest professor at Columbia University. While he may not be considered a public leader by some, he was a leader in scientific research, academics and education. He helped thousands of young people, including myself, pursue graduate education in the U.S. His example inspired me to help others achieve a good education and build a better future.","The Blueprint for Maryland's Future sounds promising on paper with its goals, but the funding presents a significant problem. Without adequate financial support, implementing the Blueprint will be challenging. In our school district, we have not received sufficient funding from the state and county to fully implement the Blueprint. This has contributed to budget shortfalls, leading to staff cuts, program reductions and increased class sizes. Many teachers have already expressed concerns about the negative impact of staff shortages and increased class sizes. If these issues are not addressed, we risk seeing lower graduation rates and a reduced percentage of high school graduates achieving college or career readiness.","I support the policy limiting student cellphone use during instructional hours, as there is growing evidence of the negative impact cellphone usage has on children’s mental health and classroom instruction. Our district should implement a policy restricting student cellphone use during instruction hours. This policy should also include clear, easy-to-implement procedures for enforcement to avoid confusion and ambiguity.","We can always improve student safety in our schools, and I am not satisfied with the current efforts. We need to do more to eliminate school violence and fighting and to enhance both the physical and mental well-being of our students. Food safety should also be improved to ensure that no spoiled milk or food is served to students. Repeatedly deferring school maintenance poses significant physical and health risks, as some schools are falling apart, dealing with mold, and facing cockroach and mice infestations. Additionally, overcrowding in some schools presents fire safety risks. Addressing these maintenance and overcrowding issues must be a top priority to improve student safety.
","I believe there are circumstances when certain books should be removed from school libraries, just as certain content has been removed from school curricula over the years. Educators, parents and students should work together to decide which books should be included or excluded from school libraries, using transparent criteria for book selection. The focus should be on choosing books that help students achieve college and career readiness, which is a key component of the Blueprint for Maryland's Future.","I believe that keeping parents in the dark is not a good approach, just as it's not ideal for parents or fellow students to withhold important information from the school about a student. If there are concerns about sharing information with other parties, we should find ways to address those concerns. Schools and parents should work together as a team to educate and raise students."

","<p>A decade and a half of advocacy and community service brought me the knowledge, experience, and motivation to serve my community and the young people of Howard County by running for an at-large seat on the board in 2022, and now to run for the District 1 seat. My goal is to have excellent schools providing a world-class education that prepares every student for a bright future. To do this, I believe we must remove barriers to learning by:
<p>- addressing math and reading skills gaps
<p>- following Individual Education Plans and 504 plans with fidelity, supporting students, families, and staff as partners
<p>- connecting students and families to needed resources, whether for physical or mental health
<p>- having both high expectations for students and the necessary support to achieve them
<p>- protecting students from bullying, discrimination or ostracization because of their race, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender identity, sexual orientation, family make-up or any other actual or presumed status or identity
<p>- giving educators what they need to succeed in their jobs and compensation that reflects their expertise and professionalism
<p>I am also committed and ready to build consensus with other board members and funding partners to advocate for needed funding, while being a wise steward of taxpayer funds. I will also push for transparency and accountability, listen to stakeholders, and make data-driven decisions.","My background in the preschool classroom and as a community leader, education advocate, and Howard County Public School System parent have uniquely qualified me to serve on the Board. As a recipient of Free and Reduced Meals and other programs for families in poverty as a child, I personally experienced the importance and power of public education to change lives. Serving others in my community has been a lifelong pursuit. I have followed and participated in the work of the board for 15 years and am ready to bring my experience, creative problem solving, consensus building and passion for education to this role. My time on the Operating Budget Review Committee and many years of parent/teacher association leadership deepened my understanding of the fiscal and other challenges we face. Those familiar with my leadership have described me as fair, calm and level-headed. Serving as one of the co-chairs of last year’s Operating Budget Review Committee, I had an opportunity to put into practice calm leadership and consensus building in what can sometimes be a fractious group because of its size, passion and diversity of opinions, not to mention the difficulty of last year’s budget. I am ready to bring these needed skills to the board. ","<p>The most important issue facing Howard County Public School System is the budget, because it touches everything in our school system and every challenge we face. It directly impacts our ability to hire and retain the best teachers and staff in the face of a national teacher shortage. It impacts our ability to expand access to mental health resources for our students at a time when social and emotional issues are creating a crisis for our kids. This results in both behaviors that disrupt the learning environment as well as internalized impacts like anxiety and depression. It directly impacts our ability to meet our legal requirements to our students who should be receiving special education services but are often not getting what they need and what they are legally entitled to. Inadequate funding has also led to school overcrowding, which hurts our already vulnerable students the most, and to our long list of deferred maintenance, which could be hurting the health and safety of everyone in those buildings. 
<p>The board must be united in asking for the funding that is needed for our schools. As a member of the board, I intend to continue my advocacy for dedicated, additional revenue sources for our schools, for both the operating and capital budgets. The board also needs to continue to be a check on the superintendent to ensure that we are being good stewards of the funding we receive, making wise financial decisions and entering into contracts that adequately protect our interests.","I admire Whitney Young, a civil rights leader after whom my high school was named. Though he is not as well known today, I respect his intelligence, his persuasiveness and his life of service dedicated to solving the biggest problems of his day. He worked with multiple presidents, both Democratic and Republican, on advancing civil rights. He also emphasized the importance of education and good jobs with opportunity for advancement in breaking cycles of poverty, inequality and discrimination. Like Young, as a leader I recognize you need to work within a system to effect change, but you cannot be afraid to take a bold stance against injustice.","The Blueprint offers us an opportunity to invest in our schools and ensure an excellent education for every student. While some changes may be needed in how the law is implemented and funded, its aims are ones we absolutely want to achieve. We want to expand access to early childhood education, attract and retain amazing teachers, help students become college and career ready, and make sure that every student has the educational support they need to succeed. While additional state funding is being promised for the future, in recent years, Howard County has had reduced funds to sustain programs that are highly valued but not legally mandated. We will have to work together: the board, the county executive, the County Council, the state and the community to fund the excellent school system we want to have. We have to work together to find dedicated revenue for our schools, to ensure that that funding does not get diverted to other things, and that it keeps pace with inflation and the growth of our county. Public education is an investment that we cannot easily calculate the return on, but it is an investment that is essential. It’s essential for building vibrant communities, for increasing opportunities for all, for maintaining a functional democracy, for continued innovation, and for having a people prepared to face the challenges and opportunities of the future.","Phones should be put away and silenced during class. They should be out of sight and out of mind. It should not be on teachers alone to enforce this. Our middle school installed a locker in the office, and any student misusing their phone must lock it up until the end of the day. We also need support from parents. If alerts are off and phones are away, they can leave a message for the student to get to later. Urgent messages can be called into the office. There are reasons students may need to have a phone, like medical, work or for peace of mind as they walk to and from school. That is why we must help students learn to self-regulate their cellphone usage but also enforce policies when students are not able to by themselves.","I believe there is much that could be done to improve school safety. Every student should feel safe and be safe in school. We must start while students are young to give them tools for dealing with conflict and seeking help when needed. I would like to see more counselors in our schools so that we can provide students with productive solutions to the challenges they are facing. Additionally, we need to complete planned capital projects to improve the safety of our school entrances. School safety is not a one-person job. It really does take a whole community.","Sometimes as books age and physically deteriorate, they may need to be removed from school libraries. Books that have outdated or incorrect information, as well as books that have harmful stereotypes or language that has changed meaning over time, may also get removed. Media specialists and librarians have training and education specific to curating and maintaining a collection of materials appropriate for the ages they serve. While our media specialists and librarians are best equipped to make these decisions, community input has a place as well. Opportunities for the community to weigh in are readily available. As always, parents guide what their own children read or view, but no single person or group gets to dictate what every student may access. I will always support diverse and inclusive materials that enrich learning for all students.","Our schools must be a safe place for all students, especially if they don’t have a space with the people who should love them the most. Policies that allow transgender and nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns, while not informing parents of their decisions, are designed to protect children who do not have a safe and supportive home environment. Childhood is a challenging time, particularly for those who are navigating their gender identity. I hope that schools can be a place where we can help parents build on their love for their children and find ways to be supportive."

<p>Reducing the administrative burden on teachers allowing them to focus more on instruction. 
<p>Sustainably lowering the student-to-teacher ratio, enabling more personalized learning and helping to close achievement gaps. 
<p>My goal is to create an educational environment where all students can thrive.","I admire Mitch Daniels, former president of Purdue University. Under his leadership, tuition was frozen from 2013 and remained in effect even after he left in 2022, making higher education more affordable for countless students, including my sons, who started at Purdue during his tenure. During his time at Purdue, the university experienced significant growth, with a strong focus on public-private partnerships that enhanced resources and ensured students graduated with skills that made them highly employable. He also led the creation of Purdue Global, an online platform expanding access to education for working adults and non-traditional students, showcasing his innovative approach.

The Blueprint’s objectives, including increased funding for early childhood education, higher teacher starting pay, college and career readiness standard, and expanded services for multilingual and impoverished families, present both opportunities and challenges for our district.
<p>Achieving the mandated $60,000 minimum starting salary for teachers by 2026 requires careful planning and resource allocation. I am committed to ensuring that, while we meet this mandate, we also address the need for fair compensation for veteran educators. By studying successful models from across the country, I aim to implement retention strategies that are tailored to the specific needs of Howard County. This will involve reallocating resources within our budget, collaborating with stakeholders and exploring innovative solutions to attract and retain top talent.
<p>To create an environment where educators feel valued, it is crucial to provide fair pay scales, safe and well-resourced workplaces, and a culture that is free from physical violence, harassment and retribution. Additionally, I believe in developing “grow your own” programs that support both current employees and students, aligning with their needs and fostering long-term commitment to our schools.

This methodical and inclusive process ensures that any policy we implement is well-informed, balances the benefits and challenges of cellphone use, and is tailored to the specific needs of our students, teachers and families. By taking the time to evaluate and test the best options, we can develop a policy that truly enhances the learning environment while addressing the concerns of our community.","While I have heard anecdotal concerns about safety from both educators and students, I recognize the need for objective data to fully understand the scope of the issues.

I am committed to supporting efforts that will create a secure and positive learning environment where everyone feels safe.","I believe that decisions about which books belong in school libraries should primarily be made by educators and librarians, who are trained professionals with the expertise to evaluate educational materials.

These relationships are key to navigating the difficult challenges in county and state funding, local and state legislation, as well as fostering positive interactions within these partnerships. 
<p>In summary, I am running because I can make our education system better for all children in Howard County schools.","<p>I have the experience, expertise, knowledge base and temperament to be a highly effective board member. Not everyone will agree with all of my policy decisions or actions, but I am known for my ability to craft solutions, move things forward and get to consensus during difficult deliberations.

I have expert-level knowledge on school system policy as well as state-level education legislation from my years on the board and my advocacy work prior to being elected.

<p>My work in education spans nearly 30 years and includes being a parent-teacher association president, secretary, grants writer, science fair coordinator, project manager for cultural arts and literacy programs, Community Advisory Council president, president and administrator for East Columbia Preschool, founder of Parents At Home (a nonprofit), Blessings in a Backpack coordinator (feeding food insecure youth). This body of work in education — preschool through adult education — should not be underestimated in its value to Howard County Public School System students and staff. ","<p>The most pressing issue of the next four years will be recovery from the pandemic. This is complex because its effect was felt by students, families and educators — personally and operationally. Identifying how students suffered and determining how to make up the gaps will be the underlying driver for our education system in the near term.
<p>An additional complication arising in part from the pandemic was the thinning of the employment pool for educators and other employees. There are simply not enough educators available for hire, and universities are not producing sufficient qualified graduates to meet the demand. I will work on developing an array of incentives to retain educators. This could include financial incentives for working in high-needs schools, working in special education classrooms and becoming a nationally board certified teacher. We also need to work with our county funding partners for student loan forgiveness, affordable housing set-asides for educators and other innovations. Human Resources will also need to widen the recruiting pool outside of the local area to include Historically Black Colleges and Universities with robust teacher training programs. 
<p>Another area where we will begin to feel the lasting impact is financially with the drying up of the pandemic relief funds. Federal relief funds were able to supplement our budget for technology, tutoring, summer programming pay raises, enhanced localized ventilation units (portable HEPA units) and some capital projects. Absent new revenue streams, Howard County Public School System will be hard pressed to absorb continued costs into our operating budget.","“Nevertheless she persisted” has been an important motto to me ever since it was uttered about Elizabeth Warren by Mitch McConnell when the United States Senate prevented her from speaking during the confirmation hearings of then-Sen. Jeff Sessions as U.S. attorney general. I admire her for continuing on despite the men around her trying to silence her. She is representative of the many women who have had to fight for their voice to be heard. Sen. Warren remained steadfast despite the discrimination that she was subjected to while male senators were able to do what she was stopped from doing. I admire her fortitude, her aptitude, and her persistence.","<p>I fully support the goals of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. It has the ability to improve educational outcomes for students, to ensure our educators are paid professional wages, to solidify mental health services in our schools, and more. It will provide near universal pre-kindergarten in partnership with private providers. Universal pre-kindergarten is the single most effective tool for improving student outcomes for historically underserved populations.
<p>The college/career/community ready standards will continue to make sure that our students are leaving high school ready to embark on the next part of their life with high chances for success. Our commitment to have students ready to go into a trade or the military needs to be as strong as that of our commitment to have students ready to succeed in college.
<p>If we can fully implement the Blueprint, the Howard County Public School System should be able to see increases in reading and math proficiency, increased graduation rates, increased rates of students in apprenticeships, more students completing career training pathways, more students being dually enrolled in college classes during high school, improved student mental health outcomes and improved teacher recruitment and retention.","<p>I believe that cellphones need to be out of the classrooms. Our teachers can either teach or police cellphones, but they cannot do both. Simply put, many of our students (and many adults) are addicted to their cellphones. They cannot be present and ready to learn with a cellphone on their lap or desk distracting them. We need to provide structure and set restrictions to support them. 
<p>Evidence is mounting that in emergency situations in schools, cellphone use by students can make them less safe by increasing the traffic load on the network — possibly overloading it, by circulating rumors that make it difficult to address the real emergency and by texting parents who then flock to the school, which may get in the way of public safety officials and potentially putting parents into the zone of harm.","<p>The school system needs to continue to install secure vestibules in every school, modernize all camera systems, ensure all external doors are secured and locked, and ensure all radio communications are easily connected with law enforcement. If we remove cell phones from the classrooms, we need to ensure that all classrooms have functioning landlines for teachers to connect with the administration, security personnel and families to be able to get messages to students.
<p>In terms of students’ interactions with other students, we need to continue to provide mental health supports in schools, teach social-emotional learning, and educate students on how to interact with peers in a respectful and healthy way. When we encounter fights among students, we need to find the root causes and address them as well as administer appropriate consequences.","<p>I place great confidence in our professional media center staff. Books that are not age-appropriate generally do not enter the libraries in the first place. Subject matter experts (school media specialists, librarians, educators) should be trusted to approve appropriate material for placement in libraries. In the case where books are challenged, it is the subject matter experts whose opinion I value since they have been trained in determining age appropriateness and appropriate content for inclusion given their knowledge of the curriculum and educational standards.
<p>Further, a diverse and inclusive set of library books are critical to have in our schools. We need to actively work to include these materials despite extremist fear mongering and demands for removal. I support the inclusion of books that are LGBTQ affirming, historically accurate, and do not whitewash past racism, sexism, violence, misogyny and discrimination.","<p>School districts should absolutely and without reservation enact policies to fully support transgender and nonconforming students and to allow them to use preferred names and pronouns regardless of their parents’ views and support. I do not believe the school district should be required to share these preferred names or pronouns with parents when requested not to by the student. Studies show that having one supportive adult in a transgender or nonconforming student’s life can decrease the risk of suicide. 
<p>If we can save lives by using preferred pronouns and names, then it is incumbent on us to do so. It is not only a good thing to do, but also the right thing to do. 
<p>I am an LGBTQ ally."

","University of Maryland School of Law. Admitted to the Bar Associations of Maryland  and the District of Columbia.
","As a leading gun safety activist in Maryland, I have cultivated relationships at all levels of county and state government. I’ve proven myself to be effective, as evidenced by my lengthy track record of meaningful legislative victories. As a Board of Education member, I will apply my advocacy expertise to doggedly pursue solutions locally and statewide to assure we maintain academic excellence in an environment that is safe, inclusive and attractive for students, teachers and staff. Students who aren’t well can’t learn well. Students who don’t feel safe can’t learn. We experienced horrific gun violence in District 5, including a murder-suicide this year and a lockdown before that. Students are afraid to walk to school, whether it’s from bullying or unsafe infrastructure like traffic and buses. They feel unsafe and unvalued when they get there. We don’t make them safer by turning these schools into bunkers and interrupting lessons with shooter drills, redirecting money that should go to remediating dangerous radon and mold, fixing lighting, and keeping their class sizes manageable. There’s no evidence that the militarization of schools does anything to increase safety, but there’s lots of evidence that it increases distractions and anxiety. I am the champion for the safety of students and staff.","<p>I am deeply passionate about public service and public safety. My entire adult life has been devoted to both. When I began teaching graduate courses 25 years ago, I discovered I had a passion for teaching too, so I never stopped. Howard County is my hometown, and it has given a lot to me over the years. I would be so proud and honored to give back as a member of the Howard County Public School System Board of Education — but more importantly, I have skills that this board needs. I have professional expertise in the areas of contract scrutiny and vendor accountability, and I have been trained to anticipate and consider the potential consequences of making changes to complex systems. For my entire career with the Food and Drug Administration, I balanced the priorities of the government, the American consumer and a variety of small and large businesses. I have extensive experience with legislation and policy that will translate well to the Board of Education. I have also volunteered as a liaison for teens studying abroad, to teach them how to address problems in communication and agreements with host families on the expectations of families and hosted students. I volunteered with the County Court to negotiate between parties in cases headed for court so they could define their own terms of the settlements they sought.
<p>Families know that they can trust me to prioritize safety in all the forms it takes. And educators know that I value and support them for the unsung heroes that they are. ","<p>The board must advocate to the county and state for new revenue streams for our schools. This endless budget crisis coupled with deferred maintenance is an unsustainable, self-inflicted wound. The reserve fund we have raided the past few years is not some extra “bonus” fund; it is money to pay for salaries and obligations that are billed for the five-to-seven weeks before the end of the fiscal year that become due in the next fiscal year. We don’t have enough revenue streams. The county knows it, and our delegation in Annapolis knows it. A bill introduced to get funds from new development is a good start, but we need to keep looking
<p>I expect the superintendent to identify any/all areas where money is being spent unwisely. This year, the superintendent has proposed cutting nearly 350 positions across the school system. I would be prioritizing the classrooms over everything else. Budget decisions should never result in anything that would undermine Howard County Public School System’s ability to offer a high quality education to students. Cutting school-based staff and increasing class sizes are examples of things that undermine education. I expect to see a recommended FY26 budget with sensible, realistic reallocations that only propose cuts that won't negatively impact the classrooms. Related to this, we need a policy requiring performance reviews for all management. The board should make the superintendent’s contract contingent on meeting clearly defined expectations, including the budget, for example, and for getting the special education department off of Maryland State Department of Education probation.","I admire former state Sen. Charles “Mac” Mathias, because without his tireless work to support the Chesapeake Bay, one of our state’s most precious resources, the marine environment in Maryland would have died. His work with the surrounding states who were dumping into the top of the bay and our watershed were tireless and effective, and the bay continues to be an economic engine and endless source of recreation for our state in large part because he championed this issue. I also admire our entire Howard County delegation representing us in Annapolis for their effectiveness in championing issues across party lines that improve the environment, gun safety, education and health care in our state. I am proud to have earned their endorsement and look forward to continuing working with them for our schools.","Society as a whole benefits from expanded pre-kindergarten. Minimum starting salaries for new teachers should have been mandated a long time ago. We need to improve hiring and retention for teachers. Our county’s special education program is on probation, and we need the additional resources provided in the Blueprint. Finally, it improves preparation beyond K-12 to improve readiness for college and careers. We have a lot to celebrate and look forward to in the Blueprint. We can all agree on the goals in the Blueprint. Change is rarely painless. And school districts don’t have much discretion in how they approach new mandates. The Blueprint is largely prescriptive in its implementation, mandating expenditures with few exceptions. The real challenge will be in how we approach all the things we want to keep that aren’t required by state law. ","Policy 8080 (the district’s longtime policy on technology, digital tools and social media)  is no longer meeting the needs of our school communities. Teachers and educational support professionals continue to experience unacceptable levels of classroom distraction and disruption. They have been placed into competition for students’ attention against this highly addictive and often abused technology. Cellphones in our schools have created a full-blown crisis, and tremendous harm has been done to our students. Just as many technologies can be used for good or bad, science has documented physical changes in our children’s backs, necks, fingers and brains from phones. They interfere with listening and learning, and facilitate bullying, distractions and even depression. I will sit down with administrators and educators, review the changes to Policy 8080 together step by step, and ensure that the updates meet everyone’s needs and don’t create potential for unintended consequences, particularly to our most vulnerable students.","No, I am not satisfied. My commitment to public safety was channeled into gun safety activism after my husband was killed by a mass shooter. It was through this advocacy that I learned about the safety risks facing our students. In the United States, guns are the No. 1 killer of children, but it is not the only risk they encounter each day. Bullying, mental health struggles, technology addiction, unreliable transportation, larger class sizes, fewer fine art enrichment opportunities, portable classrooms, overcrowding, poorly maintained buildings, food insecurity, poor indoor air quality, and bigotry are all eroding the well-being of our students and staff. Students who aren’t well, can’t learn well.  In order to focus on academics, we must take on these safety challenges and provide students and staff with a stable learning environment. ","<p>No, primarily because these large-scale efforts are motivated by bigotry. On rare occasions, parents may discover that their school library contains a book that is not age-appropriate. They may involve the Howard County Public School System Resource Reevaluation Committee, composed of teachers, parents and community members that reviews challenges and reevaluations; I would like to see that robust process remain in place. But the book banning campaigns we’re seeing now are gratuitous. The current effort underway in Howard County targets 46 books at once, all of which depict the experiences of marginalized communities. All 46 titles were carefully selected by subject matter experts and highly trained professional librarians whom I trust.
<p>Parents’ rights include the right to be free from the efforts of others to determine which books are available to their children.","Students who don’t feel safe can’t learn. The best school communities support students on their journey to adulthood while they experience and grow into the people who they are and will become. They make sure students don’t have the distraction of fear, or a lack of safety, while they are trying to learn. For decades, students have chosen their names, nicknames and titles in classrooms, playgrounds, and activities at school without incident and without the need to clear these preferences with every parent. I believe students, just as everyone else, should be able to continue to do so. For many students, school is the safest place they have. "
Howard County District 5,Trent Kittleman,y,www.trentkittleman.com,www.facebook.com/trent.kittleman.1,TrentKittleman@verizon.net,Over 50,None.,Law degree from the University of Maryland.,"Because I am passionate about education. Because eight years in the Legislature brought me face to face with the depth and breadth of problems inherent in the current state of public education. And because I have five grandchildren in Howard County Public Schools. The Board of Education needs a knowledgeable, experienced leader who knows how to read a contract and what questions to ask of staff. Too many avoidable problems are happening. Students should be transported to school on time, in buses, and not have to walk up to two miles; and they should feel safe once in school. Deferring maintenance is unacceptable; our students should never have to endure schools with mold, mildew, bad air quality and too few bathrooms! Housing our students in over 250 “temporary” relocatable classrooms due to a lack of capacity in our school buildings isn’t reasonable, particularly when we could use a public-private-partnership to build six schools in two years — as Prince George’s County did. And the persistent failure to meet the needs of our special education students must come to an end. While Howard County still stands as a premier public school system, our academic scores are falling behind those of other counties. I want to see that this stops, and that our schools — just like our students — are once again the best and the brightest.","<p>Experience in education: I’ve volunteered as a judge for our fifth-grade Simulated Congressional Hearing program for 13 years, judging numerous schools each year. I write a monthly newsletter titled A Voice for Parents, and I am a current member of the Howard County Public School System Resource Reevaluation Committee.  As a delegate, I participated in designing the Kirwin Blueprint, and every day during session, constituents talked to me about all facets of education. The most compelling conversations were with special education teachers who came down every year begging for relief from the constantly-expanding clerical requirements of their job.
<p>Financial experience: As CEO of the Maryland Transportation Authority, I was responsible for the $3.4 million operating budget and the over $6 billion six-year capital budget, giving me a useful understanding of how to maximize budget dollars.
<p>Leadership: As deputy secretary of transportation, I created and guided a stakeholder committee that raised the paratransit on-time pickup from 75% to over 90%. As CEO of the Maryland Transportation Authority, I was able to get the Bay Bridge’s third lane reopened before summer. In both roles, I was an instrumental part of getting the Intercounty Connecter (Route 200) built.
<p>Consensus-builder: I served for 18 months on the Montgomery County Transportation Task Force II. We were given an almost impossible task of arriving at consensus among 34 members ranging from tree-huggers to AAA members. Getting a decisive majority vote to build the Intercounty Connecter was my greatest achievement! Moreover, as a delegate, I spent eight years successfully working with legislators across the aisle.","<p>It’s hard to choose just one, but despite our considerable efforts, Howard County Public School System is still having difficulty providing an adequate education to many of our special needs students. We need to:
<p>1. Undertake strategic planning. Another crucial step, which Superintendent William J. Barnes has recommended, is to involve all stakeholders in a genuine effort to devise a strategic plan that will examine all facets of our special education efforts including looking for answers that have worked in other counties or states.  
<p>2. Share health costs with the county. A significant part of the special education budget goes to employing health care professionals. Health care is the responsibility of the state and county governments. It is time to talk with the County Council about assuming certain of the special education health care expenses that are currently funded in the education budget. It is possible that  there may be economies of scale found in combining these services.  
<p>3. Shift the “burden of proof.” For several years, our formerly bipartisan Howard County delegation unanimously approved, and the Board of Education has supported, a bill to shift the burden of proof from the parents to the school system in cases where the parents feel they must take Howard County Public School System  to court to get satisfaction. These cases are almost always about decisions involving Individual Education Plans. When parents know they can afford to challenge such decisions, Howard County Public School System tends to resolve them without the need to go to court. This saves both Howard County Public School System and parents a good deal of money.","<p>It's difficult to limit my admiration and respect for Thomas Sowell to 150 words. He is  a scholar, an economist, a philosopher and a world-traveler who writes cogent and well-documented books (45 to date) and columns on subjects ranging from ""Charter Schools And Their Enemies"" to ""Black Rednecks & White Liberals,""  to ""Knowledge and Decisions,"" a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, heralded as a ""landmark work.""  Although he stopped writing his column at age 87, his last four books were written and published since he turned 90.
<p>Born into a poor family in North Carolina, he was raised by a great-aunt in New York City, where, as an African-American, he first experienced racism. Nonetheless, he wound up at Harvard, where he graduated magna cum laude. He was offered positions both as federal trade commissioner and U.S. secretary of education by different presidents but declined both offers.","<p>During its passage in the legislature, the fact that the bill imposed a significant unfunded mandate on both state and counties made cost the primary concern. In Howard, the Blueprint has added significantly to our current budget needs at a time when our revenues have fallen 
<p>The goals of the plan are laudable. Rewarding teachers who obtain national certification with a bonus for teaching in Title I schools is working. Creating academic standards to ready students for college and/or career is laudable. Howard has seen some success in expanding childhood education to full-day but does not have the physical space to meet the Blueprint goals. 
<p>One issue raising costs is that local systems must implement Blueprint programs exactly as set forth, when counties may already have similar, successful programs. An alternative is for the state to “certify” a county program as adequate to meet Blueprint standards.

<p>One specific concern for Howard County is that the Blueprint requires 75% of the state funds to “follow the student.” This means that schools with high concentrations of low-income, high-needs students will see increases in overall funding while schools such as those in the western part of Howard County will see a decrease. It is estimated that high-needs students could provide their schools as much as $26,000 per such student, whereas non-high-needs students might provide as little as $6,500. While most of us strongly agree that students with special needs should get more funding, the anticipated gap seen here may be too large.","According to Howard County Public School System Superintendent Bill Barnes, students’ cellphone use is the top concern of teachers in Howard County. Although parents worry that cellphones provide a necessary means of contacting their students during the school day, there are practical solutions that take both parent and teacher concerns into consideration. I would support the solution used by an East Baltimore school that had success, as well as buy-in from their students, using a pouch specifically made for this purpose. At the beginning of the day, student cellphones are locked into a pouch that stays with the student during the day. An administrator controls unlocking the pouches as students leave the school.  The process of getting her phone unlocked was a bit cumbersome initially, but it only took a couple seconds and soon became routine according to students.","<p>The board’s decision to double the walking distance and increase the number of students walking last year created serious safety issues. Numerous incidents occurred last year, and we are fortunate that nothing truly harmful has happened. Despite the board approving a decrease in the walking distances, the new plan won’t go into effect until the 2025-26 school year, leaving our pre-kindergartners still obliged to walk up to one mile this year. That needs to be changed, now.
<p>Another major effort at keeping our students safe is to put school resource officers in every school —  not just high schools. These officers are specially trained to perform their unique service function, and they are much appreciated by a large majority of parents.
<p>Finally, student-on-student violence has escalated; without adequate consequences that actually deter such behavior, no student is safe.","<p>The misnomer “book banning” being criticized these days is an effort by many parents to have certain books removed from school libraries due to what they consider explicitly sexual content. It is not unreasonable to have explicitly sexual content “that serves no redeeming social purpose” removed from the schools.  
 <p>I would have more respect for those who are so incensed by the effort to “ban books” if they (the liberal left) had not so very recently gotten a number of different books actually banned on a national level. These six books were all by Dr. Seuss!  In 2021, a group of  liberal educators, experts, academics, and specialists in the field, convinced Dr. Seuss Enterprises to cease sales and publication of several children’s titles including ""The Cat’s Quizzer, “McElligot’s Pool,"" “And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, and “Scrambled Eggs Super.”  Don’t want those people making these decisions.","<p>Regardless of the subject matter, I oppose any initiative that seeks to withhold information from parents. It is imperative to recognize that parents hold the ultimate responsibility for raising their children; attempts to undermine this fundamental role are both misguided and potentially harmful. 
 <p>Educators, particularly teachers, play an essential role in educating our children, imparting knowledge and skills that are critical for their development. However, there is a concerning trend within the education establishment, which appears to be gradually absorbing responsibilities that have traditionally belonged to parents. While it is acknowledged that not every family has the financial means to provide even basic necessities, such as adequate meals, and that the school system has appropriately stepped in to assist in these areas, we must draw a clear line when it comes to matters of cultural, moral and philosophical upbringing. The responsibility for guiding children in these areas should remain with parents."

","Given the educational and behavioral health needs of our current student population, I believe it’s vital to have a board member who is well-versed in both of those areas who understands the complex needs of our current student population and who can effectively advocate on their behalf to achieve better educational and employment outcomes for all of our students. I am running because I understand what it's like to work in a school and be a parent of a child that needs more support. I live both sides of that equation, and I believe in the power of collaboration between schools and families, and I know how to advocate for mutually respectful partnerships. ","<p>I’ve been a proud Kent County Public Schools parent for over 18 years. I’ve been a special education professional for over 10 years and a practicing licensed professional counselor for over two years. I am expert by experience in supporting my own children through their mental health and educational struggles. I advocated on behalf of my children to receive additional supports from the school and community to help them through those difficult periods. I am grateful for the support I received at their schools, at my local church and from their therapists. 
<p>I also served as a liaison between nonpublic schools in Maryland and Maryland State Department of Education to represent the needs of transition professionals in nonpublic schools. I regularly attended statewide trainings for transition professionals and collaborated with a variety of state agencies, nonprofits and employment providers to connect students and their families to the supports needed to help students achieve their educational and employment goals. ","<p>Statewide, our student proficiency rates in math and English are suffering, and Kent County is no different. Teachers are burdened with tasks that extend far beyond instruction. I believe we can better utilize support staff in our schools to assist teachers with non-instructional tasks so that teachers can focus more on teaching. Additionally, given the diverse needs of our student population, it’s more important than ever to provide targeted professional development to teachers that equips them to build strong professional relationships with students and parents, manage classrooms more effectively and create learning environments that are more structured and engaging.  Teachers also need to feel supported by their administrators in every school, and as a district it’s vital that we improve in-house communication and collaboration so that there is consistency in the behavioral expectations set and maintained in each classroom.
<p>I believe as a district we need to regularly engage with statewide initiatives like Maryland READS (Reading Education Aligned to Data and Science) and local partners such as Open Doors Partners in Education so that our students have more access to additional support outside of the classroom. I’ve participated with local and statewide work groups and consortiums that bring professionals together and partnerships like these are invaluable when it comes to addressing and meeting students’ needs. As a board member, I would actively seek out and participate in cross disciplinary collaborations so I can better advocate for the needs of all students.","I admire Dr. Ben Carson because he remains true to his faith and trust in God and expresses himself in a humble manner in spite of all he has accomplished professionally, personally and on behalf of others. He is mission-oriented and communicates his views and intents respectfully and clearly. He prioritizes following God’s will for his life rather than his own agenda or the agenda of others. He is consistent in promoting a message of possibility for any person willing to do the work and endure the struggle that is necessary to achieve their goals. ","I believe the pillars of the Blueprint (Early Childhood Education, High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders, College and Career Readiness, More Resources for all Students to be Successful and Governance and Accountability) are designed to better close the achievement gaps that currently exist. I am especially pleased to see that career readiness is being elevated to the level of college readiness, since there is a significant shortage in skilled labor nationwide, and students can lead successful independent lives leaving high school either with a certification in a specific trade or with a solid plan to gain a certification. The overall goals and strategies prescribed by the Blueprint certainly appear to be more in line with what is needed to help all students succeed. I am concerned about the feasibility for our county to meet the budgetary requirements within the timeline set. I know that many counties in Maryland are grappling with how to be in compliance without making cuts to programs and services that students and families have come to rely upon. It’s important for the state (Maryland State Department of Education  and Annapolis) to listen to and work with local school systems as they communicate their struggles with budgetary compliance. ","Given that cellphones often are a significant disruption to instruction, have the potential for interfering with student safety and can contribute to an overall negative school experience, I believe that firm boundaries need to be established and enforced in middle and high school settings. It’s important that students understand that the use of technology is a privilege, not a right, and that this privilege can be revoked. Because the county provides tablets and computers for student use, the majority of students no longer need their cellphones during instructional time. During instructional time, cellphones should be kept out of sight and turned off. If a student refuses to comply with the boundaries established by the school for cellphone use, then an administrator should take temporary possession of the phone and follow up with any disciplinary action required. ","Overall, I am satisfied with my district’s efforts to ensure the safety of our students within the school buildings themselves. I believe we can do a better job as a district educating our students about the dangers of human trafficking and how to identify the potential red flags for relationships or jobs that may develop into human trafficking or some other exploitative situation. ",I am for informing parents about books that contain sensitive material so that they can make an informed decision about what they feel is developmentally appropriate for their child and what their child may access. ,"<p>I support the guideline outlined in “The World Professional Association for Transgender Health” that “Mental health professionals should help families to have an accepting and nurturing response to the concerns of their gender dysphoric child or adolescent. Families play an important role in the psychological health and well-being of youth. This also applies to peers and mentors from the community, who can be another source of social support.” 
<p>Since families play an important role in their child’s well-being, and schools cannot guarantee confidentiality with the open use of preferred pronouns and names, I believe it is best to inform families before changes occur. Youth experiencing gender dysphoria often have co-occurring struggles like anxiety and depression, and parents are in the best position to ensure that all psychological health needs are addressed. "

The law ensures a pre-kindergarten seat for every 4-year-old in the state and every 3-year-old with specific needs, while increasing resources for families with young children. The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future creates college and career pathways for students to choose from, including agricultural sciences and technical education. This will support our local economy by increasing the earning potential of families from low and middle socioeconomic statuses.
<p>The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future brings our communities together. It creates community schools, which support student achievement by connecting community resources to our students, schools and families. This can include support with housing, food access and after-school learning. The Blueprint can only be successful if we the community are invested and actively hold our elected officials accountable. As a community leader, I agree with the intent of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future.","There should be limitations on cellular usage during core curriculum classes with built-in breaks but few restrictions during electives and extracurricular activities within the schools such as lunch, free periods, class transition and sports. Twenty years ago cellular phones did not exist in the classroom but have now become a way of communication, life and culture for the younger school-aged demographic and their families. The saying ""we must pick our battles"" often comes to mind while working in the current school environment and cellphone usage. ","All staff, students and caregivers should feel safe within our school district. Our school system should have programs from restorative justice, conflict awareness, health centers and community resources in all schools within our district. Collectively efforts should be designed to address root causes of negative behaviors and create positive school cultures. We should be proactive and not reactive with implementing strength-based resources while reaching the students that need them the most. All staff should have ALICE (short for “alert, lockdown, inform, counter, evacuate” active shooter) training and policies that are in place should be enforced. I would also consider mandating staff training on social-emotional crises, bridges out of poverty and bullying. School safety supports a culture of learning, and school safety efforts must become more transparent as it relates to communication with parents during emergencies on school property.","Over the past several years there have been requests for the removal of questionable books by community members in our school district. Before any official decision is made the book in question should be discussed on a case-by-case basis within the Board of Education leadership with guidance from the superintendent and state law when being reviewed. From my understanding, curriculum teams vet books and literary texts to ensure they are meeting guidelines. Book removal must follow school system policies and procedures. If as a parent/guardian or student you feel as if the content being published in our school libraries are inappropriate for your values, ""op-out."" Our school system needs to be one of inclusiveness that welcomes all walks of diversity while the parent/guardian has full authority to make that decision for their household.",I decline to answer this question at this time.

<p>Philosophically, I am a good candidate as I believe all children deserve a good state-provided education. A good education allows the recipient to compete on a level playing field for quality jobs. In that regard, education undoes the cycle of generational poverty. Perhaps equally important, the future of the republic depends upon a well-educated constituency, familiar with reason, logic, ethics and morality, and capable of critical thought.
","<p>The most important issue facing our school district is the combination of limited resources and anti-school bias. I live in a county that has a historic issue with managing its school district adequately. We are not a poor county; however, our middle school is decrepit. By some surveys it is beyond economic repair. The middle school could stand as a testament regarding the district at large. A sizable portion of our school-aged demographic is homeschooled or attends private school, at least partly due to Kent County Public Schools’ reputation. A small student body means the administrative overhead is higher than it otherwise would be when calculating per capita student costs. Each of our schools meet the threshold for designation as a Title 1 school. Title 1 students require more resources, further raising the per capita cost of educating our students, which in turn feeds negative bias and grows a positive feedback loop.
<p>I would counter these influences with advocacy and propagating reliable information. I also strongly believe an independent audit of the county and its various departments would allow us to move forward with a clean slate.","U.S. Navy Capt. Brett Crozier, former commander of the carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, who became a public figure when his love of the crew was so great, and his professional ethic so robust, that he sacrificed his career for the health of the crew and the good of the mission. His actions embodied sacrifice, devotion, bravery, ethics and morality.","<p>The Blueprint is law. We should make every effort to meet its requirements. If there are instances in which it is impossible to meet those requirements, we should coordinate with the state to find interim solutions.
<p>The Blueprint will help Kent County be competitive when recruiting staff. It also makes available resources to assist the more vulnerable demographics in the county. Overall, the Blueprint is a positive.","I believe we should look to subject matter experts for specific guidance on how technology impacts young minds and the educational process. That being said, we are now aware that many of the apps, particularly social media, are driven by algorithms that are addictive and/or harmful to minors. With exceptions for instances where phones are linked to medical devices, as an example, they should only be available outside of instruction and study activity.","<p>I have a hard time imagining what books might be wholly devoid of educational use. Even “Mein Kampf” offers an insight into the mind of a monster and the arguments such a person would use to reshape society. I could see limiting access as an alternative to bans, which are distasteful by nature. Education often involves discomfort, and an education system that protects students from discomfort also insulates the student from learning.
<p>If bans are absolutely necessary, again I would defer to subject matter experts such as child physiologists and experts on educational theory.","<p>I have a hard time imagining what books might be wholly devoid of educational use.

Montgomery County At Large,Lynne Harris,y,null,null,Lynne4Students@gmail.com,62,I am currently an at-large member and vice-president of the Montgomery County Board of Education,"Bachelor’s of science in nursing, University of Tulsa; law degree, Washington University School of Law in St. Louis; master’s of health science from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
","<p>I am running for re-election to continue pushing all of the initiatives I have been moving and to provide strong support for our new Superintendent.
<p>Some of my areas of work: enhancing community and student engagement informed by the unique communication needs and preferences of each school community, more transparency in all of our work accompanied by true data driven accountability measures, improving our workflow so Montgomery County Public Schools is a better partner, ensuring we have solid math content and English/language arts supports, enhancing support for principals, working to better support newcomers, reforming our human resource work, championing our sustainability policy to become a net zero system, addressing structural issues in our employee benefits trust funds, ensuring expansion of important initiatives like universal pre-K is “right-sized” to actual demand, updating all curriculum to be fully inclusive and 21st century current, and ensuring our operating and capital budget recommendations are data-driven and cognizant of the challenging fiscal climate. 
<p>I have an internship group of over 180 students from across the county whom I support in their advocacy work, and to whom I listen to understand the student perspective on Montgomery County Public Schools — student wisdom, the customers of Montgomery County Public Schools, is essential in every priority setting, policy making and problem-solving conversation.
<p>I have had a ringside seat to everything happening in Montgomery County Public Schools for the past three-plus years — the good, the bad, the neutral. That experience empowers me to celebrate what’s working, fix what’s not, and focus intently on financial realities and accountability.","<p>I am a good candidate for the Board of Education because I have served in this role for the past three-plus years, some of the most difficult in recent memory, during which the board was able to move Montgomery County Public Schools forward with the leadership changes we needed and the hiring of an excellent new superintendent.
<p>During my service I have chaired the Fiscal Management Committee, using that committee to examine many areas of Montgomery County Public Schools through the lens of operational excellence, which has included providing unprecedented support for the sustainability initiatives our team wanted to enact, enhancing the clarity of Montgomery County Public Schools public-facing contracting documents, and spearheading a workflow analysis to identify bottlenecks in our contracting, procurement, and MOU processes.
<p>My board service has been informed by my 15 years as an education advocate—as a local PTA leader, 10 years as a county-wide parent-teacher association leader (serving as Montgomery County Council of PTAs vice president of educational issues, vice president of advocacy and president among other roles), and my service as an Montgomery County Public Schools teacher. That work gives me a deeply substantive understanding of the breadth and depth of issues confronting a large school system in 2024. 
<p>I work extraordinarily hard in this role, and do my homework to prepare for every meeting, work session and public hearing. I believe the quality of my work and preparation is evident at any board or committee meeting, all of which are livestreamed then permanently posted on the Montgomery County Public Schools website for anyone to view.","<p>The most important work of the Montgomery County Board of Education in 2024 is to create a strong relationship with the new superintendent, built on trust, open and continual communication and information-sharing, and a shared vision of high expectations for every area of work. Directly connected to that is to create the conditions and provide the support for him to succeed.
<p>Inherent in creating that relationship and support is standing firm in the belief that the primary job of central office is to support principals and schools, so that they have the resources and supports they need to succeed, and sharing the superintendent's strong belief that education is a people business, and Montgomery County Public Schools must get better at treating people like people – with empathy and respect – even during difficult times. ALL people -- staff, students, families, community.
<p>For me the question isn't what will I do about this issue, but what AM I doing about this issue.  During the superintendent search process I was very frank about the need for honesty, trustworthiness, humility and kindness in all aspects of the work of MCPS. Finding candidates that shared that belief was a non-negotiable for me in the selection of the new superintendent. 
<p>Since July 1, I have continued to both communicate and model these expectations – for openness, honesty, consistency and humanity.","<p>Barack Obama. I was one of the inspired in 2008 when I was the parent of a kindergartner and a full-time public health graduate student at Johns Hopkins. That inspiration led me to take a 70-hour/week unpaid job as a field coordinator for the Obama campaign in Fairfax County — for three months I did my parent job, my student work, and slept little as I worked from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. Monday to Friday, and 16 hours a day on weekends.
<p>Why? Because I saw a leader who was whip smart but had no ego. Who was compassionate and pragmatic. A leader who believed in true social justice, that everyone has value and should have the opportunity to share their talent. I saw a leader who shared my view that public service — as a teacher, healthcare professional, government worker and on and on — is the highest calling.","<p>I continue to be a big fan of the work of the Kirwan Commission to perform a holistic and objective analysis of the state of public education in Maryland, and make straightforward recommendations about the steps required to transform our public school system into one that is globally competitive.
<p>The Blueprint that emerged is both practical and aspirational — and as with all such things, merging the aspirations with reality requires focus, commitment and pragmatism.
<p>Montgomery County has already taken actions with significant budgetary implications to accelerate the achievement of Blueprint goals — the two-year salary agreement that significantly enhanced teacher pay is an example. Montgomery County Public Schools has also significantly invested in pre-kindergarten seats, a challenge in this fiscal climate is to right-size that investment — so supply doesn’t exceed demand. Like all other counties, Montgomery is finding the Blueprint vision of a 50/50 mix in public/private pre-kindergarten seats by 2026 likely unachievable — private providers are struggling with Maryland’s onerous bureaucracy around licensing and certifying pre-kindergarten educators and facilities. 
<p>Montgomery County Public Schools has also greatly expanded supports for emergent multilingual learners — a growing segment of our enrollment — our challenge is to ensure evidence-based best practices are the foundation of those supports. We are also expanding our industry partnerships to provide truly meaningful internship and apprenticeship opportunities for the increasing number of students participating in career and technical education programs—but we must work to transform MSDE policies which create obstacles for career and technical education participation—certain graduation requirements and the unweighting of many career and technical education courses are two examples.","<p>As a former teacher, I know the ongoing distractions and challenges cellphones place on student engagement in the classroom. As a public health practitioner who focuses on prevention, I know that the predatory nature of social media algorithms truly damages youth mental wellness, and the addictive nature of screens is real.
<p>I support an “away all day” cellphone policy — to improve student engagement, social emotional development and academic outcomes. I closely follow the experience of school systems and states that have already banned phones, and have had conversations about process with Dr. Thomas W. Taylor, who came to Montgomery County Public Schools from a school system that recently banned cellphones.
<p>We must move forward in a thoughtful, thorough way — cognizant of new realities like student medical needs requiring periodic phone access, or learning challenges supported by technology, and cognizant of what we can learn from systems that are ahead of us.","<p>Montgomery County Public Schools aims to be thoughtful and constructive in addressing safety and security concerns, which requires far more than student discipline, policing and infrastructure. One of the most important strategies to create safe schools is ensuring schools are inclusive places where everyone feels welcome and valued. Working closely with the Positive Youth Development teams is also essential – merging their work addressing, defusing and healing community conflict before it can erupt in a school with the work happening inside schools to support students and combat hate in all its forms.
<p>From an infrastructure perspective, Montgomery County Public Schools is installing more security cameras and door alarms, plus technology enhancing emergency communications to overcome “dead zones,” and working to create cohesive culture in schools so that everyone partners to make schools safer. We’re strategically increasing security staffing, and assessing weapons detection technology from an operational standpoint, looking at the experience of systems currently piloting it","<p>I am no fan of banning books. The only instance in which I can envision supporting the removal of a book from a school library is when that book is truly age-inappropriate for the students who patronize that library.  

<p>Decisions about age appropriateness should be made by professional librarians using transparent guidelines, not public opinion. Free choice books in a library are just that — open to someone to choose if they wish. If families want to restrict the books their students read, they have many avenues to do that — but imposing those choices and personal judgements on thousands of others is not appropriate.","<p>I wholly support Montgomery County Public Schools policy supporting students in safely expressing their gender identity. Our policy allows students to use facilities aligned with their gender identity, use their preferred pronouns, and we are focused on creating gender-neutral facilities and communications along with fully inclusive and affirming classrooms.
<p>Our policy is governed by student safety — LGBTQ+ youth are the most at-risk. They are the most vulnerable to being unhoused, rejected by family, and most at-risk of bullying, hate, anxiety, depression and suicide. Policy must be situated in reality. Accordingly I am proud that Montgomery County Public Schools policy is to provide a welcoming and supportive space for students, to support them in expressing their gender identity, and to partner with families in supporting LGBTQ+ students EXCEPT when the student tells us they will not be safe if family are informed."

My belief in the transformative power of education to uplift individuals and communities is based on my own experience as a part of the gifted and talented program in a Bronx public school and as a Prep for Prep student. It drives my passion for serving on the Board of Education.

Through these experiences, she gained valuable insights into the multifaceted landscape of education and emerged as a champion for academic excellence.","<p>We need to implement academic rigor in our k-12 curriculum. As predicted by many, Montgomery County Education Association and Montgomery County Public Schools joint COVID policies resulted in significant learning loss and other long-lasting physical, social and mental harm to our children, especially our most vulnerable. Chronic absenteeism now afflicts nearly all of our schools. Reading and math scores dropped precipitously despite thousands of hours dedicated to tutoring. Literacy readiness dropped 35% for second-graders year over year from 2018-2019 to 2020-2021. Math readiness for fifth-graders was down 25%. Literacy for Black second-graders decreased by 38%. Hispanic second-graders had a 46% drop. At Kennedy High School, only 9% of students meet math proficiency standards. While we welcome the small improvements in scores since, parents must remember the role Montgomery County Education Association and union-endorsed board members played in causing this decimation of our students’ learning.
<p>As recommended in ""The Opportunity Myth,"" these are the actions I will take: ""Every student should have access to grade-appropriate assignments, strong instruction, deep engagement, and teachers with high expectations, every day, in every class — regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other part of their identity. We will continually investigate the extent to which our students receive this access and report on our progress."" 
<p>""Every student and family is an authentic partner and should have real opportunities to shape the experiences students have in school, receive accurate and accessible information about students’ progress, and have a legitimate role in decision-making. We will continually seek feedback from all students and families about whether we’re living up to this commitment.""","James Madison, known as the Father of the Constitution, is a historical public leader I admire. He served on both the local and national stage, crafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom as well as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. He also authored many essays contained in the Federalist Papers and served as president of the United States. I appreciate his dedication to outlining Enlightenment ideals such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion and freedom of the press. I admire the amount of studying he did in order to attain a profound knowledge of Greek and Roman governance. His dedication to the American people is one I care to emulate as a member of the Board of Education. He said, “The people are the only legitimate fountain of power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government hold their power, is derived.""  ","<p>Rebuilding the foundation of academic excellence is necessary within Montgomery County Public Schools. Unfortunately, enacting the Blueprint without bringing accountability to the Board of Education and the school district will only worsen academic outcomes for our children. Lawsuits and costly scandals plague Montgomery County Public Schools, stealing precious resources from our children. From the Beidelman debacle leading to the departure of former Superintendent Monifa McKnight, Montgomery County Public Schools cannot move forward until it responsibly dedicates resources to improve reading and math scores in the district.
<p>As such, the Blueprint's goal of providing more resources to ensure all students are successful will require diligent oversight by Board of Education members. We need programs that aim to close the achievement gap, in particular ones that emphasize a student's agency by giving students and their families greater responsibility over their learning through the K-12 years. When academic rigor is introduced and high behavioral expectations are in place, students and their families have goals they can actively strive for. 
<p>Making sure that students have the opportunity to participate in apprenticeship programs no matter where they live in the county is also important. It should not matter if you live in Poolesville or Silver Spring, Montgomery County Public Schools resources should be available to all students. College and Career Readiness goals are for every school in every corner of Montgomery County. ","Montgomery County Public Schools should implement a phone ban in all schools. Currently, there are a number of schools participating in a pilot phone ban policy to determine effective methods to put this ban in practice. At Quince Orchard High School, for example, students do not have access to social media apps even during their lunch breaks, when they are allowed to use their phones. Studies show that cellphones in the classroom serve as a major distraction to learning. As a former Gaithersburg High School social studies teacher, I have firsthand experience watching students struggle with content and skills taught in class, not because they lacked the ability, but because they were focused on their phones instead. In addition, cellphones can inhibit peer-to-peer interactions. We want our children to grow intellectually, socially and emotionally. Restricting cellphone use will help ensure that happens at a proper developmental pace. ","<p>Since the removal of school resource officers, a string of major fights broke out at Clarksburg High School, a student was arrested for bringing a loaded gun to Gaithersburg High School, another student was charged with threats of mass violence at Wootton High School, and there was a violent brawl at a Montgomery County Public Schools football game.  A Kennedy High School teacher testified before the Board of Education about rampant vaping and drug activity, quoting a police officer who referred to the school as an “open air drug market.” Knife-wielding vandals have easy access to campus. Students have overdosed on campus, as the county has experienced a +120% increase in youth fatal overdoses. 
<p>Parents, the data is clear – Restorative Justice and the Community Engagement Officer paradigms don’t work. They put our children’s safety at risk. We know that school resource officers served as mentors and role models to our students. We know that their presence in the schools was a positive contributor to school safety, and thus the learning environment. 
<p>Fraternity Of Police Lodge 35 Vice President Lee Holland agreed with parents on their importance. He cited ""countless examples"" of school resource officers confiscating guns and drugs, preventing sexual assaults and discovering sexual predators within the public school system. We need to bring back our school resource officers.","Maryland state law provides for parental involvement in sex education and allows parents to review instructional materials related to sex education and to request exemptions for their children from certain portions of the curriculum. I would extend these same provisions to our school libraries. Montgomery County Public Schools should respect the religious freedoms of families as protected by the First Amendment by restoring this policy. This would be consistent with Montgomery County Public Schools'  Memorandum from the Superintendent at pp. 5-6, adopted by the Board of Education on June 17, 2014. Each school should be able to determine with their body of parents which books should be removed. ","Teachers should absolutely be supportive of students who are struggling with their gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation and family/parental status by providing an environment where the child is welcomed and loved. Concurrently, in order to preserve and protect the integrity of the family unit, Montgomery County Public Schools should share any information with parents if Montgomery County Public Schools becomes aware that a student wishes to transition to a gender other than his biological sex. Parents play an essential role in their child's overall health, and we must respect that. Of course, at all times, we will do our best to care for our children who are vulnerable and ensure that we do our best to prevent bullying, threatening, and harassment. "

Although she made history through her pursuit of office, her life’s story is a powerful testament to leadership, community engagement, advocacy and perseverance. As a Black woman also from humble beginnings, I find her journey deeply inspiring. She has broken countless barriers and exemplifies how to show up as your authentic self while championing justice, equality and the empowerment of marginalized communities.","I fully support the recommendations outlined in the Blueprint for Maryland's Future. I'm especially encouraged by its focus on expanding early childhood education and providing services for multilingual and low-income families. To ensure more positive outcomes for our youth, I believe we must offer consistent, high-quality support to students and their families from an early age. This is particularly important for marginalized communities and multilingual students in my district. I would advocate for increasing family support services, expanding public funding for full-day pre-kindergarten and implementing effective assessments to ensure students are ready for kindergarten. Additionally, I would work to support literacy efforts both in and out of school, including in alternative early learning settings. If elected, I will also push for full funding of Prince George's County’s portion of the Blueprint, as it’s crucial to addressing the needs of our schools and improving their trajectory. This funding is essential for involving key stakeholders and making sure the necessary resources reach our students.","I support placing limits on cellphone use in middle and high schools. While I recognize that cellphones are important for student safety, allowing families to communicate with their children during emergencies, they can also be significant distractions in the classroom. Issues like cyberbullying and violence are examples of the negative impacts cellphones can have on student safety and mental health. I think it's worth exploring a policy that stops the use of cellphones during class and designates specific areas for storage.","While my district and the county have implemented safety measures like enforcing clear book bags and using metal detectors at school entrances, I believe more can be done to improve school safety. Schools should prioritize not only physical safety but also students' social and emotional well-being. This could include increasing the number of support staff and providing access to resources and training to effectively handle conflicts. I also think there should be a greater emphasis on emergency preparedness and increased advocacy for gun control at higher levels. By balancing these areas, building on existing measures, and also beginning to address some of the root causes contributing to violence and unsafe schools, we can create a safer environment for all students in our schools.","I do not support the broad removal of books from school libraries. Books play an important role in helping students learn, understand history and find their place in the world. Reading books that offer diverse perspectives is essential for building critical thinking skills, which are vital to a student’s development both in and out of school. I would only support the removal of books that do not foster this growth, opposing books that present narrow or harmful views of the world. Decisions about which books to include or remove should be made by a diverse group of stakeholders, including students, families, educators and leadership, to ensure that all voices are heard.","I believe students should be empowered to express themselves and feel safe at school, regardless of how they identify. However, I also recognize the importance of parental involvement, especially for minors. Ideally, parents should be informed about such decisions, with school support staff helping facilitate family communication when needed. Family involvement is critical, but before enforcing any policy, I would ensure that sharing information does not put the student’s safety at risk. It’s essential to balance supporting students’ well-being while maintaining open communication with families in a way that protects all parties involved."

",Master’s degree in human services counseling (criminal justice) from Liberty University.,"As a Prince George’s County Public Schools parent, I saw the lack of parent representation on the board and thought we needed more input from people who have a true vested interest in our schools.","A good candidate for the school board is a person who is professional, is willing to find solutions to recurring problems and always leads with integrity. To me, a good candidate is also a very personable person, responsive and organized. I am all of those things and more. ","The most important issue facing our school board is our budget. If elected, I want to take a serious look at our funds and if they are allocated properly. There doesn't seem to be a lot of transparency when line items are decided. Because of this, we have seen major negative impacts in our schools – negative impacts with our infrastructure, special education programs and teacher salaries.","A public leader that I admire would be Shirley Chisolm. She was the first woman and African American to seek the nomination for president of the United States from one of the two major political parties in 1972.  I admire her because despite much opposition and discouragement, she still believed in herself and pressed on no matter what the outcome would be.  ","<p>The Blueprint will have a significant impact in our schools. One major change is the conversion of nearly one-third of Maryland schools into community schools. These schools will have a coordinator to address specific needs like academic and language supports, nutrition, and medical, dental and mental health care.
<p>However, the Blueprint also presents funding challenges. By 2034, local school districts are expected to pay significantly more annually than they would have without the Blueprint. This could strain our district’s budget and require careful financial planning.
<p>On the positive side, the Blueprint aims to provide more resources for students who need them most, including low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities. These measures are designed to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed.
<p>Additionally, the Blueprint emphasizes the importance of high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders. This will involve new training programs, higher salaries and better career pathways for educators, which should help attract and retain top talent in our district.
<p>Overall, while the Blueprint presents some financial challenges, its focus on equity and comprehensive support for students and educators aligns well with our district’s goals. It’s an ambitious plan that, if implemented effectively, could bring about much-needed improvements in our education system.","I have personally seen the level of distraction in the classroom when cellphone usage is not monitored.  During instruction, scholars are listening to music, watching explicit content or preparing an opportunity for cyberbullying. On the flipside, cellphones come in handy when there is a connectivity issue within the school and can come in handy in case of an emergency situation. Teachers have taken it upon themselves to build policies of their own to limit distractions in their classroom, and they have seen tremendous improvement. I would support a policy on student use of cellphones in my district because we need to support our children in receiving and retaining circular content, rather than social media content. ","As a parent, I have expressed to the board my dissatisfaction with the district's efforts to ensure the safety of our scholars. I think there needs to be a growing partnership with local law enforcement to remedy serious threats. In addition to that, more security presence would be helpful. Not all schools have metal detectors, and some only have one which at times have decreased instruction time due to long security lines before school.  ","I do not believe in banning books, and as an avid reader, I encourage individuals to read topics that interest them. I would also want the board to consider parent and community input when books are suggested for the curriculum. On the campaign trail, parents have argued they were never aware of what their scholar was reading until it was too late. They felt disconnected and would have loved to be a part of their child's learning and development, especially when going over comprehension skills.  ","As an involved Prince George’s County Public Schools parent, I believe parents should have the opportunity to participate in their child's academic and social development. Not sharing that information with parents can separate and cause division within the community in which we serve. The point is to build partnerships, not disengage with parents who are willing to learn on how they can support their scholar."

<p>My holistic approach to education is rooted in my core values of family, faith and fostering lifelong learning and strong communities. I believe in the transformative power of education to shape individuals and communities for the better, instilling values of curiosity, resilience and collaboration. I am dedicated to ensuring that every individual has the opportunity to access quality education and thrive in a supportive environment. As a wife and mother, I understand the importance of nurturing future generations and empowering students to thrive academically, personally, and professionally.
<p>Joining the school board for me, is a calling — an opportunity to contribute to building a better community.","<p>I am an excellent candidate to continue serving on the Prince George’s County School Board because I am deeply committed to being responsive and results-driven, always ensuring that the needs of our community are at the forefront of my work. I actively listen and engage with community members, making informed decisions that truly reflect the desires and concerns of those I represent.
<p>My consistent presence in the community — whether through meetings, events or direct outreach — demonstrates my dedication to staying connected with the people I serve. I don't just hear concerns; I take action, driving meaningful changes that lead to tangible results.
<p>Moreover, my unwavering focus on student academic success, combined with efforts to build strong, supportive communities, has created an environment where students can thrive. By prioritizing the whole child, advocating for mental health supports, and ensuring safe, nurturing spaces, I’ve laid the foundation for lasting academic and community achievements.
<p>This combination of responsiveness, results, and a focus on both academic success and community strength makes me a standout candidate for continued service on the school board.","<p>As a community and a school system, we face multiple critical issues impacting our schools, including teacher shortages, school safety, the social-emotional well-being of students and staff, expanding educational opportunities and addressing aging infrastructure. Among these, the shortage of teachers and ensuring the physical and psychological safety of our school community stand out as top priorities.
<p>As your District 5 school board member, I have already begun addressing these challenges. To combat the teacher shortage, I successfully advocated for the expansion of the resident teacher program, which supports aspiring educators in obtaining their Maryland state certification. I remain committed to pushing for increased teacher compensation, enhanced recruitment efforts and partnerships with higher education and industry.
<p>In terms of school safety, I recently secured the installation of alarms at Bowie High School and continue to champion comprehensive safety measures, including training and resources for all schools. Responding to the rise in bullying, I advocated for additional funding to expand anti-bullying initiatives and spearheaded revisions to our bullying policy to improve its effectiveness. Recognizing the importance of mental health, I passionately advocated for the establishment of calming rooms in elementary and middle schools, providing students with a sanctuary to alleviate stress and refocus.
<p>Furthermore, I am proud to have advocated for the establishment of a science technology engineering math (STEM) charter school in District 5 this academic year. I will continue to push for the modernization of our school facilities and the expansion of educational opportunities through innovative programs and partnerships with community organizations.","<p>The public leader I admire most is my father, Ambassador Alfred Machayo. He was a man of profound integrity and unwavering commitment, whose values earned him deep respect not just within our family but throughout our community. My father's life was a testament to the principles he held dear, and his example has been a guiding light in my own journey.
<p>One of the most important lessons my father taught me was that when you take on any task or responsibility, you must give it your all. He always said, ""Don’t just do it — ensure it is your best work."" He modeled this value every day, never settling for anything less than excellence. His dedication to doing his best has been a standard I've strived to uphold in all aspects of my life.
<p>Another lesson he imparted was that our talents are not meant for personal gain but for the betterment of our community. My father believed deeply that we have a responsibility to use our gifts to leave the world a better place than we found it. He measured success not by accolades or wealth but by the number of people we helped succeed. This selflessness and commitment to service have profoundly shaped my understanding of leadership and continue to inspire me in my own public service.","<p>The Blueprint also emphasizes enhancing the teaching profession through improved career ladders and compensation. By valuing and supporting our educators, we not only strengthen the respect and dignity of teaching but also attract the next generation to this noble career path. This investment in teachers is crucial to building a future where education is synonymous with excellence.
<p>Moreover, the Blueprint ensures that college and career readiness is at the forefront of our educational goals. Every child deserves to leave their K-12 experience equipped with the skills and options to pursue the career paths they desire. Whether they choose to attend college or enter the workforce, the Blueprint for Maryland's Future provides the tools and opportunities needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive global economy.
<p>In essence, the Blueprint is more than just a plan — it's a commitment to the future of our students and our state, ensuring that every child is prepared to achieve their full potential.","Our policy on cellphones is that they should not be used during the school day. This ensures that students can fully focus on their instruction without unnecessary distractions. Cellphones often lead to interruptions and can tempt students to engage with social media or other non-academic activities. By keeping phones off and stowed away, we remove these distractions, allowing students to concentrate on their learning. While I believe that technology has a valuable role in education, it should be carefully monitored and used to enhance teaching and learning, not detract from it.","Our school district is committed to continually examining and implementing practices that prioritize the safety of our students and staff. As a school board member, I actively support these efforts and advocate for the necessary funding to ensure we have the resources needed to keep our schools safe for everyone.",Each jurisdiction has a policy on how books are reviewed for instructional purposes.  We must strive to ensure books are age-appropriate and also a balance of intellectual freedom. Our First Amendment supports students’ rights to access diverse viewpoints.

I am running for re-election to the Prince George’s County Public Schools Board of Education because this is the public school system that prepared me for the career I have today. Further, it is the system my parents went through and the future educational system my two children will enter starting next year. During my first term, I am proud of the work we have completed to navigate academic challenges like regression seen through COVID, work with our stakeholders and unions to build six cutting-edge new schools, and increase mental health resources for both our scholars and educators across the county, with still more to come. Moving forward in District 7, we have honed in on true partnership and fostering community to elevate the educational experience for everyone in our school buildings. Together we are working to create safe school communities through addressing the physical, emotional and social well-being of students, educators and parents. We have continued to support the creation of an environment in Prince George’s County Public Schools that not only offers fair compensation for educators but also fosters a culture of individuality and creativity, through the full funding of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. As the current representative, I acknowledge the unique challenges each district faces. Moving into a second term, I will continue to elevate the parent voice, lead through partnership with our administration and provide a unique skillset to our board.","As a graduate of Prince George’s County Public Schools, lifelong resident and now father of two scholars, I have a uniquely vested interest in the status of our educational system. Every decision I make has a direct impact on educators, who taught me, or my children's future experience in Prince George’s County Public Schools. The Prince George’s County Public Schools Board of Education needs to reestablish trust with the residents of Prince George’s County with candidates who are intentionally and unselfishly pursuing office to be focused on the elevation of each and every student. During my first term on the Board of Education, I have worked to:
Promote parent/community partnership. 
Prioritize safe schools. 
Champion climate friendly priorities. 
Pioneer science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) programs.
Support the expansion of mental health services. 
Oversee the capital improvement plan budget resulting in the completion of six Public-Private Partnership (P3) schools, and much more. 
I have a record of leadership amongst my colleagues and the Administration, serving as the chair and vice chair of the Operations Budget and Fiscal Affairs Committee, chair of the Ad Hoc Climate Change Action Plan Committee, liaison to the Parent and Community Advisory Council, an ex-officio member of the Academic and Achievement Committee, and presently vice chair of the Board of Education. Aside from my role as a board member, I am a globally recognized rocket scientist and have worked at the collegiate level, helping to establish undergraduate and graduate-level degree programs for both domestic and international universities. These initiatives have engaged with students across Singapore, Kenya, Rwanda, Melbourne and parts of North America.
","The Prince George’s County Public Schools school board faces a significant challenge in addressing the persistent achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. While the board cannot directly implement educational programs, we play a crucial role in shaping the district's overall direction and ensuring accountability. In doing so we can focus on actionable steps within the authority of the board under the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland & Title 13A of Code of Maryland Regulations. To address this issue, the board can continue to develop clear evaluation structures that hold the superintendent and district leadership accountable by monitoring the district's progress towards achieving its goals. During my term we have worked to reconstruct indicators of the superintendent’s evaluation, prioritizing the academic success of our scholars through measurable outcomes, such as the improvement of early literacy in grades kindergarten-third and the improvement of quarterly cohort readiness of four-year graduation rates. We’ve worked to address the culture of schools, with a focus on social emotional learning and mental health by targeting chronic absenteeism, reducing suspensions/expulsions and stakeholder safety at school/work. The board must continue to allocate resources strategically, ensuring that funds are distributed equitably to support schools in underserved communities, including investing in capital improvements to address aging school facilities. Since 2020, District 7 has completed over $107M in capital improvement projects with an additional $424M planned by 2030. Additionally, partnership with the community must be prioritized to intentionally address community concerns reaching the school house and advocacy at the state/federal level to implement strong policy reform.","I deeply admire Dr. Alvin Thornton for his transformative leadership and unwavering commitment to educational equity not only within Prince George’s County, but on a national level. As senior advisor for academic affairs at Howard University, he has played a pivotal role in advancing academic standards and fostering institutional growth. His leadership of the historic Presidential Commission on Academic Renewal and his contributions to the Middle States Commission on Higher Education underscore his dedication to institutional excellence for our scholars. Extending beyond Howard University, his work as chair of the Maryland Commission on Education Finance, Equity and Adequacy revolutionized the state's education financing system, ensuring more equitable distribution of resources. This visionary approach in the Thornton Commission laid the groundwork for addressing disparities in educational funding, a legacy he continues to support through current initiatives with the Kirwan Commission — the Blueprint for Maryland's Future.","I am excited about the generational impact of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future on Prince George’s County Public Schools and will continue to serve as an advocate for the full funding of the Blueprint. This includes a partnership with Strong Schools Maryland & serving on committees with Dr. Alvin Thornton, one of the key developers for Maryland’s Commission on Education Finance, Equity, & Excellence, also known as the Thornton Commission. As we continue to advocate for this crucial funding, Prince George’s County Public Schools must do everything we can to increase our chances of success. The Blueprint will impact our district through targeting hiring/retention, community schools and preparing our scholars for the next step in their journey. Through my work with the chief financial officer and her staff, we aim to improve transparency in tracking “Blueprint dollars.” This will show fiscal responsibility in the proper allocation of funding and highlight the correlation between it and positive gains, indicating the need for these resources. The Blueprint will aim to address hiring and retention concerns by offering a higher starting salary and incentives for educators. I believe this is a great resource as we continue to elevate and improve the full career environment for our educators. Providing them a safe and efficient place to grow their career and educate our scholars. We’ve worked to adjust board policy 1100 and remove outdated provisions that hindered flexibility in implementation of the Blueprint and adjusted the Community Schools Steering Committee to reflect the rich diversity in Prince George’s County Public Schools. The time is now, our children cannot wait for a high quality and world class education. ","<p>Presently our Policy and Governance Committee has already begun the work to revise Board Policy 5132—Portable Electronic Devices—in the Schools. I believe it is critical to revise and strengthen the Portable Electronic Devices policy to reduce distractions and promote a more focused learning environment. While cellphones can be valuable tools for learning and communication, their misuse can hinder student success. I have encouraged colleagues to prioritize the following actions:
<p>- Implement a clear and enforceable ban on Portable Electronic Devices use during instructional time
<p>- Educate students and staff about the negative impacts of excessive Portable Electronic Devices, thus encouraging responsible behavior and promoting a healthier learning culture.
<p>- Consider reimaging technology to restrict Portable Electronic Devices use. 
<p>- Continue to involve parents and the community in the policy development process. By leveraging student workgroups such as the Student Member of the Board Student Advisory Council and Parent and Community Advisory Council groups, we can ensure that the policy is fair, effective and aligned with the needs of our students and community.","I am proud of the improvements our district has made, but I believe we can do more. Physical/building safety is a concern across the nation that we cannot afford to ignore. I worked with the administration to provide updated security measures for our most at-risk schools through the Security Enhancement Equipment Rollout Plan impacting our middle and high schools. Mental health support, including counseling, therapy and crisis intervention, to address the emotional and psychological needs of students and educators is critical to the goal of safe schools. I have supported and advocated for the expansion of mental health awareness through budget amendments and recommendations to the administration. To date, Prince George’s County Public Schools has committed to a multi-year $2.9 million+  initiative. Through our Policy and Governance Committee the board aims to strengthen policy 5143 to provide clear anti-bullying policies that define unacceptable behavior and outline procedures addressing incidents of bullying or harassment. ","<p>I believe that while freedom of speech is a fundamental right, it does not extend to content that promotes mental or physical harm. The decision to remove books from school libraries must be approached with careful consideration of the potential impact on students. It is my opinion that books should be removed from school libraries under the determinations reflected in a Prince George’s County Public Schools policy and via a review of an established committee. The decision to remove a book should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the age and maturity level of the impacted students, the context of the book and the potential harm it may cause. In my opinion books that should be under consideration should include the following context: 
<p>- Glorification of hate speech
<p>- Explicit and graphic sexual content
<p>- Promotion of violence
<p>- Provocative behavior
<p>- Misinformation or historically iInaccurate 
","The decision to allow transgender and gender nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns without informing parents is complex. Schools should prioritize student well-being and create a supportive environment. While open communication with parents is important, addressing student needs should be the primary focus unless there's a risk to their mental or physical health. By collaborating and being sensitive, schools can create a more inclusive learning environment for all students. While the school district's top priority is the educational success of each scholar, policies such as this play an important role in the holistic experience."

As a teacher and principal, I woke up every day driven by the belief that education is the key to unlocking opportunity, particularly for students from marginalized backgrounds. I still hold that belief today, and I want to work to ensure that every child in our county has access to that same opportunity.
<p>Growing up in a single-parent home as a Black boy in the Deep South, my family taught me the power of a good education. I was the first in my family to graduate from college and earn a Ph.D., and I owe much of my success to the dedicated teachers and school leaders who believed in me.","<p>What makes me a strong school board candidate is my 13-year journey dedicated to serving students and their families. I've had the privilege to work as a teacher, a middle school principal, an education policy expert and now a professor of education policy and leadership. These roles have equipped me with a well-rounded perspective on the needs of students, educators and the community.
<p>As a teacher and principal, I witnessed firsthand the challenges students face, particularly those from marginalized communities. This experience fuels my commitment to equity in education. As a policy expert, I've worked on solutions to these challenges, ensuring that decisions are made with the best interests of students in mind. Now, as a professor, I help shape the next generation of education leaders, grounding them in the values of justice, inclusion and high-quality education for all.
<p>My experience across these roles and working for the U.S. House of Representative Committee on Education and Labor enables me to understand the complexities of education from multiple perspectives. This makes me uniquely qualified to bring about informed, thoughtful decision-making as a school board member, always with the goal of creating equitable opportunities for all students.","<p>We pay far too much in taxes in this county for our schools not to meet the needs of every family. The most urgent issue facing our school board is ensuring that all students have the opportunity to succeed. This depends on three key areas: paying teachers a livable wage, creating safe and orderly schools and ensuring students are reading on grade level. These issues are deeply connected, and they are why I chose to run for school board.
<p>First, our teachers deserve fair compensation. When teachers are paid a livable wage, it not only helps attract and retain high-quality educators but also fosters a more motivated and dedicated workforce, directly benefiting our students.
<p>Second, creating safe and orderly schools is essential for learning. When students feel secure, they can focus on their education. We need to invest in proactive measures that enhance safety and promote a positive school climate.
<p>Finally, ensuring students are reading at or above grade level is foundational for their long-term success. We must prioritize early literacy programs, targeted interventions and ongoing support to help students overcome reading challenges early on. 
<p>If elected, I will work to address these issues, always keeping equity and excellence for every student at the forefront.","I have always admired Congressman John Lewis for his unwavering fight for civil rights and justice. His lifelong dedication to standing up for what is right, even in the face of immense challenges, has been a powerful source of inspiration for me. Lewis’s courage, especially during pivotal moments like the march on Selma, showed the world the importance of persistence and moral conviction. His belief in nonviolent protest and his famous call to make “good trouble” reminds me that real change requires both action and sacrifice. I strive to follow his example by advocating for equity and justice in my own community.","<p>The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future places a strong focus on an issue central to my campaign: teacher pay. As a former congressional staffer who worked on the American Teacher Act, which aimed to establish a federal minimum teacher salary, I know firsthand how vital fair compensation is for attracting and retaining talented educators. The Blueprint’s commitment to increasing teacher pay is a step in the right direction, but ensuring that these measures are implemented effectively will require strong advocates on the school board who are willing to fight for the necessary funding. We need leaders who will go to the General Assembly and stand up when others question whether the Blueprint should be fully funded. 
<p>The Blueprint is Maryland’s surest path to creating beyond great schools, and it offers a comprehensive vision that directly aligns with my goals as a candidate. In addition to teacher pay, the Blueprint addresses another key issue of my campaign: ensuring students are reading on grade level. Early literacy is foundational to a student’s future success, and the Blueprint’s focus on strengthening early childhood education and providing support for students struggling to read is essential.
<p>I am excited about the transformative potential of the Blueprint for our district, but we need school board members who will ensure it’s not just a plan on paper but a reality for our students, teachers and families. With the right leadership, the Blueprint can deliver the equitable, high-quality education system that every student in Maryland deserves. I plan to be one of those leaders.","<p>As a former teacher and principal, I’ve seen firsthand the benefits and challenges of having cellphones in schools. With the right guidance, cellphones can enhance learning and keep students connected. But I also understand the frustrations they can cause when they become a distraction. However, when I think about the tragic reality of school shootings, my perspective deepens. I’ve seen the relief on parents’ faces when they’re able to connect with their children in those terrifying moments, knowing they’re safe. That peace of mind is invaluable. Most recently, with the horrific school shootings. 
<p>For that reason, I cannot support a complete ban on cellphones in schools. But I believe we can find a better way forward by working together—teachers, students, and families—to create sensible policies that balance the need for focus in the classroom with the importance of safety and communication. Our students deserve both security and the opportunity to stay engaged with their learning.","<p>While I genuinely believe that our schools are doing their best with the resources available to them, there is certainly an opportunity for improvement. Many schools in our district do not have equal access to quality safety resources, and this disparity needs to be addressed urgently. 
<p>Given the alarming frequency of school shootings, we must find sensible and effective ways to enhance safety. Right now, I don't think we are fully there, but progress is possible. We need stronger federal policies that prioritize school safety, aggressive state funding to equip schools with necessary resources, and robust local support to implement effective measures. 
<p>By investing in training, mental health resources and physical safety upgrades, we can create an environment where students and staff feel secure. With the right approach and collaboration across all levels, our schools can become safer spaces for every student.","<p>As a former English teacher, I believe that literature should be a gateway to understanding diverse perspectives, including those of marginalized communities. While I recognize that there are circumstances in which certain books may need to be reevaluated—particularly those that promote hate or discrimination—I strongly oppose blanket bans. Decisions regarding book removal should involve educators, parents and students, fostering an inclusive dialogue.
<p>Access to a diverse range of literature is vital for students' development. Removing books limits their understanding of history and identity, perpetuating systemic injustices. In my experience, open discussions around literature empower students to think critically and engage empathetically with complex issues.","<p>I firmly believe that our schools should be safe and inclusive for all students, allowing them to bring their full selves to the classroom every day. Policies that support transgender and gender nonconforming students in using their preferred pronouns are essential for fostering a respectful and affirming environment. 
<p>However, the decision to inform parents should be approached with sensitivity and care, balancing the rights of students with parental involvement. Ultimately, respecting the dignity of every young person must be our top priority, ensuring that they feel accepted and valued within their school community."

","The school board is responsible for governance and budget setting, while the superintendent manages day-to-day operations. One of the most pressing issues facing our board is how to equitably provide an excellent education for all children, despite numerous national and local challenges. Our district consistently ranks near the bottom in the state in math and reading, and I’ve heard from both special education parents and educators that urgent action is needed. Additionally, our growing population of multilingual learners remains underserved. If elected, I would prioritize creating policies that support evidence-based interventions, leveraging both community input and the expertise of our staff. Drawing on my own background in education, I would push for targeted investments in areas like literacy and language acquisition programs. I would also advocate for stronger professional development for our teachers, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to help all students succeed. To ensure accountability, I would support the use of data-driven approaches to continuously assess and improve the effectiveness of our interventions, ensuring we make adjustments based on real-time feedback. By maintaining an open dialogue with the community, I would foster a collaborative approach to solving these challenges.
","I admire leaders like Congresswomen Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for their courage in standing up for what is right and their transparency. I appreciate how they make complex issues accessible and engage directly with constituents through social media. Their progressive ideals and commitment to inclusive governance inspire me, especially in their advocacy for marginalized communities. These qualities are essential in public leadership, and I hope to bring the same level of transparency and engagement to my role on the school board, ensuring all voices are heard while maintaining a clear focus on equity and justice.","The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is transformative legislation that reflects our state's commitment to equitable education. However, it was passed without a full funding plan, and the financial implications are significant. In Prince George's County, key issues include the need to increase teacher salaries, support early childhood education and provide expanded services to multilingual learners and families in poverty. The rising costs of these initiatives, combined with inflation and existing budget constraints, pose a major challenge. As a school board member, I would advocate for additional state funding while exploring innovative solutions such as public-private partnerships or reallocating resources to ensure that the Blueprint's goals are met without compromising student or staff well-being. I am particularly excited about the Blueprint’s focus on early childhood education and career and technical education as well and the acknowledgement that education is more than just preparing students kindergarten-12 to attend college. I also see the opportunity to strengthen our multilingual programs to better serve our growing diverse population. To succeed, we will need to make sure that parents and our overall community understand the Blueprint and how it interacts with national education law such as the Every Student Succeeds Act, IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) and Section 504 of the Individuals with Disabilities Act and how we as board members are navigating all of these laws and many others to ensure equity and a quality education for all students.","There is substantial research showing how disruptive cellphones can be in the learning environment. In my experience, cyberbullying and student distraction due to cellphone use are common issues. However, I’ve also seen teachers use cellphones effectively to support learning, especially when devices or internet access are limited. Families are understandably concerned about security if phones are collected, and students need access during emergencies or while traveling to and from school. I support a comprehensive policy that reflects the views of students, staff and families while acknowledging the realities of our schools. A gradual approach, with clear guidelines tailored to elementary versus secondary students, will help ensure teachers and school leaders aren’t placed in difficult positions enforcing impractical rules. This policy should come with improved resources, such as better WiFi, safe cellphone storage and reasonable consequences for misuse that align with our vision for safe learning environments.","<p>No, I’m not satisfied, but I appreciate the progress being made. Physical, psychological and intellectual safety for both staff and students must be prioritized. Ways we can improve safety include: 
<p>1. Implementing restorative practices in every building to address conflicts as they arise and restore harmony afterward, teaching students conflict management. 
<p>2. Re-evaluating the student rights and responsibilities handbook with input from all stakeholders to ensure it promotes positive learning environments for all students and reflects our values on how to achieve that. 
<p>3. Ensuring that every student-facing staff member, including aides, substitutes and security, is trained in at least one recognized approach for responding to student needs, such as Crisis Response Institute, Response Abilities Pathways or mental health first aid. 
Additionally, physical security measures must be equitably provided across the district. By combining these measures with stronger physical safety and communication protocols, we can create a safer, more supportive learning environment for everyone.
","<p>Books that are not developmentally appropriate for the age of students in a building should not be in school libraries, and I believe our library professionals do an excellent job managing this. Reading is fundamental and opens up the world to our students. They deserve to see themselves reflected in literature and to access information that is appropriate for their development.
<p>I support Prince George’s County Public Schools’ policy allowing families to restrict access to certain books for their own child without removing them from the library. This approach strikes a balance between student access and parental concerns, while relying on professionals to do their job. There is already a process for reviewing curriculum materials, and a similar process for library books could be helpful to allow community input and ensure transparent decisions.","I respect parents' right and responsibility to guide their children, and I also believe schools are responsible for providing safe and positive learning environments. Calling someone by their preferred name or pronouns is a basic way to do that. While it’s important for parents to be informed of their child’s actions and decisions at school, the outing of LGBTQ students to parents is a complex legal and safety issue with serious, sometimes fatal, consequences. I believe policies should vary based on the age of the student, as the developmental impact on elementary children differs from that of high school seniors. If Prince George’s County Public Schools were to create an official policy on this matter, it should involve full stakeholder engagement and the guidance of an advisor knowledgeable in both the legalities, ethics and psychological impact of the situation."

","<p>One of the most pressing issues facing our school board is ensuring equitable access to quality education for all students. This encompasses addressing disparities in resources, facilities and opportunities across different schools within our district.
<p>If elected, I would prioritize the following actions:
<p>1.

<p>1. Early childhood education: By expanding access to pre-kindergarten programs, we can ensure that all children, regardless of their background, start their educational journey on a strong footing. This early investment is crucial for long-term academic success.
<p>2. Teacher quality and diversity: The Blueprint’s emphasis on recruiting and retaining high-quality, diverse educators will help address the disparities in educational outcomes. Providing competitive salaries and professional development opportunities will attract the best talent to our schools.
<p>3. College and career readiness: By creating clear pathways for students to transition from high school to college or the workforce, we can better prepare them for future success. This includes expanding access to Advanced Placement courses, vocational training, and internships.
<p>4. Equitable resources: The Blueprint aims to allocate more resources to schools with higher needs. This will help bridge the gap between underfunded schools and their more affluent counterparts, ensuring that every student has access to the tools and support they need to succeed.
<p>5.

This approach respects students' need for connectivity and emergency contact while minimizing distractions during instructional time. By implementing this policy, we can foster a focused learning environment, reduce cyberbullying, and encourage face-to-face interactions. Additionally, incorporating digital literacy programs can educate students on responsible cellphone use, enhancing their understanding of when and how to use technology appropriately. This balanced policy supports educational goals and aligns with our commitment to creating a safe, respectful, and productive school environment.","While our school district has made commendable strides in enhancing school safety, such as implementing clear backpacks and advanced security technology, there is always room for improvement. To further ensure student safety, I advocate for increased mental health resources, including more counselors and support staff, to address students' emotional well-being. Additionally, expanding the use of anonymous reporting tools like the Safe Schools Maryland tip line¹ can help prevent potential threats. Strengthening partnerships with local law enforcement and community organizations will also enhance our ability to respond to emergencies effectively. By focusing on these areas, we can create a safer and more supportive environment for all students.
",No.,"As a lawyer, I understand the delicate balance between respecting students’ rights and ensuring parental involvement. Policies that allow transgender and gender nonconforming students to use their preferred pronouns without informing parents can be crucial for the students’ safety and mental well-being, especially if they fear negative repercussions at home. However, these policies must be implemented with sensitivity and care. Schools should provide robust support systems, including counseling and safe spaces, to help students navigate their identities. Additionally, fostering open communication and education about gender diversity within the school community can promote understanding and acceptance. Ultimately, the goal is to create a safe and inclusive environment for all students while respecting their privacy and individual needs. By prioritizing the well-being of students and ensuring they feel supported, we can help them thrive both academically and personally."

I would hold them accountable to do so. Disruptive behaviors seem to be at an all-time high and with little to no consequences for disruptive students.

The teachers in St. Mary's County needed an increase in pay, as they were behind in pay in comparison to surrounding counties. The problem with the Blueprint is that the state of Maryland mandates that we comply with supplying the funding to accomplish the 10-year plan, but it provides very little in funding to help us meet the funding requirements. This is putting an enormous strain on our citizens, leading our commissioners to have to raise taxes.  ","Elementary and middle school students should be encouraged to not bring phones to school, but if they do, it needs to be powered off and put away until the end of the school day. High school students should power off their phones before entering the school building in the a.m. They should be permitted to use them during their lunch and then power them back off until the end of the school day, once outside of the building.","Yes, to a certain degree. All of our county middle and high schools have an assigned student resource officer, and each school is required to follow safety procedures, i.e., checking visitor IDs, etc. Improvements should be routine checking of all exterior doors, making sure that they are locked from the outside; administrators increasing their presence in the halls during class changes; teachers standing outside their classroom doors during class changes; and for students to be encouraged to say something if they see something.",The selection and use of books and other materials must be age and grade appropriate.  ,Parents should always be informed/contacted of such policies and decisions.

He understood how to make his points well and compromise for the good of the country. I put my country and county first in true nonpartisan work. ","While the Blueprint was touted as significantly increasing education funding, the reality is that the funding is not distributed equitably, and rural counties have been left out, by and large. We did not receive increased funding from the state to cover mandates within the Blueprint. The funding is also wealth equalized, and the state views St. Mary's County as capable of providing the funding for the Blueprint. We are expected to reallocate funding from successful programs without regard to the needs of our students to fund what the Kirwan Commission believes is needed. We have been able to increase starting teacher pay and to offer full day pre-K to eligible students only due to the support of our commissioners. The belief of the Kirwan Commission that following the Blueprint will, in subsequent years, significantly decrease our special education population.

I have attended Board of Education training at the national and state levels, served on various Maryland Association of Boards of Education committees, and earned Board Leadership Academy I and II certificates. I am approachable, accessible, accountable and actively engaged.","The most important issue facing the Board of Education is change. Change is the constant in education. With change usually comes unfunded mandates, where budgets have to be realigned to meet challenging, unpredictable and once-in-a-lifetime situations. I remain open-minded, flexible and resilient to timely, open and honest communication,  listen to all sides of issues,  explore possibilities, take action and reassess when necessary, timely and appropriate. ","The Honorable Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As a matter of fact, I was awarded the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Lifetime Achievement Award in 2024. Justice Ginsburg was the second woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg was a pioneer, visionary, fighter, unifier and tireless champion of justice. She was a role model to be emulated because she was reliable, respectful, responsible, strong, accountable, confident and a force to reckon with. She took care of her body, mind and spirit. She had a personal trainer until the last days of her life. Justice Ginsburg took a stand even if she had to stand alone. She worked tirelessly to the end of her life, and that is what I aspire to do.  ","The Blueprint for Maryland's Future is a 10-year effort intended to improve the quality of public schools with the focus on five key areas. All five areas are vitally important. Even though $16.6 billion more in state funds from 2024 to 2029 seems like a sizable amount, it would not be sufficient to make all the mandated changes. Some current programs will have to be cut to meet the required mandates, and local revenues have been strained.   ","St. Mary’s County Public Schools recognized cellphone use during the school day and its impact on learning, social emotional development and academic success. Valuing community input, a cellphone work group was established. Surveys were sent to parents, students and staff about the use of cellphones and electronic devices at schools. Also, public comments were given at the Board of Education meetings. It was determined that changes needed to be made. This is not only a county issue; it is also a national issue. We already had a policy, but our regulation needed updating. The findings of the work group were excellent. I support the new plan for elementary, middle and high school students including staff members. This change will focus on increasing learning and achievement, promoting a safe and orderly school, diminishing discipline referrals and nourishing more face-to-face contact with each other.  ","Yes, and we are always in a continuous improvement mode to be more effective and efficient. Safety of students, staff, and community is a No. 1 priority of St. Mary’s County Public Schools. In order for students to effectively learn, we need to continue providing a safe, orderly, nurturing and accepting work and learning environment. We have safety and security officers, security vestibules, controlled access, exterior campus phones, climate surveys, safety drills, school resource officers, school psychologists, guidance counselors, “if you see something, say something” program, anonymous tip hotline and more.  In addition, we have ongoing professional development and training in identifying students who need assistance. There are also partnerships with the Sheriff's Department, Maryland State Police, the Department of Social Services, the Health Department and other community partners. Are we perfect? No, but we are open to continuous improvement, new technologies and public input.","If parents have concerns about a book and they do not wish for their child to read it, they can opt out, and their child will be given another option to read. Also, if a parent believes a book is not appropriate, we have a policy to express their opinion, and a review will be made. All textbooks are placed in the St. Mary's Public Libraries for citizens' review.","As a Board of Education member, it is our obligation to follow all federal, state and local  laws as written. "

","I am running for the school board to improve the education system in Somerset County. The local school board has the biggest impact on the education system by making policies and holding the superintendent and the administration accountable for enforcing these policies. I have witnessed our school board become a rubber stamp for the administration. This wouldn’t be a problem necessarily if our school were excelling, but the system is progressively failing each year. Our proficiency numbers were the worst in the state of Maryland in the 2023-2024 school year. We keep passing students who are reading at third-grade levels entering the sixth grade. Classroom behavior is a major problem. These are major issues.","A candidate should be willing to do the work. The main focus should be on education, not  socializing. Teachers should have the undivided attention of all students. Accountability is everything. This starts at the top of administration and goes down to each and every student. We need to make sure that students are ready to advance to the next grade. I will bring all these issues to the school board. I have three children who excelled in this school system. My twin girls graduated No. 1 and No. 2 in 2021. My son graduated No. 1 in 2024. I had a big impact on all my children's education. I will do the same for Somerset County.","The number one issue is proficiency. Only 9% of our students are at grade-level math, and 30%  of our students are at grade-level reading; 91% in math are behind and 70% in reading are behind. This has progressively gotten worse year after year. Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. We need a change. I would fix the issue by doing what was said in the previous question.",Jesus Christ. Enough said.,"The Blueprint does have some good points that I agree with, but it also has some issues that I adamantly disagree with. I am concerned about using a blanket approach without the approval of the local boards. If the local board doesn’t agree with a part of the Blueprint and decides not to implement that part, the state of Maryland can cut off 20% of the funding. I think that alone is troubling. Does the state know better than the local board?  I don’t think it will make us better. State control always has had major holes with major consequences.","I am against the use of cellphones in the classroom during instruction. The teachers need the undivided attention of all the students. The teachers shouldn’t have to compete with YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok. I do believe that the only time cellphones should be used is during emergencies, which should be rare. If a student violates this rule, they would give up the privilege of cellphone use in the school.","No. A few years back, a middle school student brought a loaded gun to middle school claiming that he was going to harm himself. The police were called, and the student ran off in the woods. They apprehended him with no harm to the student. Last year, the same student, now in high school, developed a kill list. His own friends reported this to the principal. The police went to his house and found enough evidence to arrest him. He was turned over to child services and released to his parents the same night. He is back in school this year like nothing ever happened. Then we wonder why these school shootings happen. This student needs special attention and should never be allowed to be back as a normal student in the school.","Absolutely, all educational materials need to be age appropriate. Sexually explicit materials, extreme violence, extreme profanity and racist materials should be removed from libraries and curriculum. If you want your child to read these books, the public library is free. These explicit materials add no value to education. It detracts from education and encourages bad behavior.","Parents and guardians should be notified immediately. This could be a mental health issue. All children should be treated the same regardless of what gender the student claims. I don’t think it is fair for other students to be disciplined for using the wrong pronouns. This is an example: You have been in the same class with Joe for your entire six years in school. In the sixth grade, Joe changes his identity from male to female. Joe changes his name from Joe to Julie. He changes his pronouns from him to her, he to she, and his to hers. For the last six years all his classmates called him a guy. All of a sudden he claims to be a girl, and you can get in trouble for calling him Joe. Joe has to deal with this issue, not his classmates."

I love our public school system and the diversity of people, and I want to see all aspects of our educational system rise to be the best we can. I have talked to many teachers about practices that work and practices that don’t work. I look forward to working with teachers, the community and the students to make Talbot County a place where people are proud of their public school system.","I am a former teacher, having taught in private, public and at the collegiate levels. Most recently, I ran a baby bilingual program here in Talbot County, where I went into three different preschools to teach Spanish. I have the background in education. I will prioritize what teachers need in order to give their students the best product they can. I’ve also been involved in the school system here for the past 16 years. My husband and I have six children, all of whom have gone through, and are currently still going through, Talbot County Public Schools.","<p>The most important issues right now, I would say, would be academics and discipline. I will highlight my platform, which is the ABCs of education. They are: Advancing Academics, Boosting Accountability and Cultivating Character. As far as academics go, I would help to make decisions where our teachers have the necessary resources and tools they need to reach every student. I would also make decisions where our teachers have the behavioral support they need in order to teach and where students can learn. I would work to foster an environment where there are fewer interruptions in regard to behavior by proposing specific rules and guidelines to be followed and consequences and follow through when those expectations are not met.  
<p>Good character doesn’t just happen. It is not innate. It is formed day by day by what we think and what we do, and is cultivated through daily choices and actions. I would prioritize intentional activities, such as community service projects, peer mentoring, and discussions on ethical dilemmas that would encourage students to reflect on their own values and behaviors. ","<p>Ben Carson and his mother. 
<p>I love  stories where the underdog comes out on top. I revel in how they are able to overcome their circumstances and turn their challenges into stepping stones to forge ahead. Ben Carson is a man who came from a childhood marked by poverty and adversity. There was seemingly no way out of this cycle for him, his mother and brother. It was his mother who didn’t back down and continued to push her children to the extent she knew they were capable. She illustrated resilience and determination in herself and passed that on to her son, Ben. She held her sons accountable to not just the bare minimum. After years of trials, failures and successes, Ben overcame and became a renowned neurosurgeon, achieving significant medical advancements and pioneering surgeries that saved lives. 
<p>He didn’t stop at his medical career. He wanted to give back in other ways, which is why I admire him. 
<p>*He went into public service and served as secretary of Housing and Urban Development and showed a commitment to addressing issues such as affordable housing and urban development. 
<p>*He has consistently emphasized the importance of education and has supported initiatives to improve educational opportunities, especially for the underprivileged. 
<p>*He encourages a message of personal responsibility and community involvement. 
<p>These character traits are ones that I hold in high esteem and aim to imitate. ","<p>My view on the Blueprint is great if we can fund everything in it. Let’s get real, however. From where is this funding coming? If the money were in the budget, wouldn’t we have already given our teachers the raises that they so desperately need and deserve now? Why wait? This initiative has changed its name four times in the past two decades. First it was the Thornton Commission, then became the Bridge to Excellence, (which sounds great!), then the Kirwan Commission and now, it’s the Maryland Blueprint. Maybe by changing the name it will become more successful? 
<p>I don’t believe that education gurus and bureaucratic experts getting together to create a top-down program would make our local schools better. This removes the schools from the control of locally elected school boards and puts control into the hands of unelected bureaucrats. 
<p>Also, since this Blueprint is mandated by the state of Maryland, it doesn’t matter what my view is on it, it will have to be implemented whether or not we have the appropriated funds. This puts added stress on the county and ultimately will make us cut programs that are specific for our county in order to fund what the Blueprint tells us we have to fund.","<p>This is a great question. I have talked to a number of teachers about cellphone use in school, and they unanimously tell me the same thing: Ban them. We at least need to adopt a cellphone policy for the county. 
<p>I would propose that they be banned in elementary-middle school and to carry only in pouches in ninth -12th grade, which can be ripped open in case of emergency. Why? Decrease anxiety and depression.  Decrease classroom distraction with bullying online, drama and games. Increase engagement in work and student-to-student interaction. If Talbot County wants to lead the way on protecting our kids from short attention spans and gaps in core knowledge,  this is the number one thing that needs to happen.","<p>The safety of our students is indeed a big concern for all. I believe there is a multifaceted approach here, and this is where I speak again on my platform of going Back to Basics, the ABC’s of education: Advancing Academics,  Boosting Accountability and Cultivating Character. Student discipline in school plays a crucial role in enhancing safety for children both in and out of the school environment. When schools implement clear behavioral expectations and consistent disciplinary measures, it fosters a sense of order and respect among students. The structured atmosphere not only reduces incidences of bullying and violence on school property, but also instills important values that students carry into their daily lives.  As children learn to navigate social interactions positively, their improved behavior extends beyond school walls, leading to safer interactions in their communities. Ultimately, a well disciplined school environment promotes a culture of accountability and respect that benefits students everywhere .
<p>As a county we have to adopt policies in which students know the specific rules and where they know the consequences dealt if these rules are broken. It’s just like parenting. If there is a rule, there must be follow-through, and it must  be consistent. When there’s no follow-through and no consistency, things are out of control. The key word here is consistency. We need to be consistent across-the-board. ","<p>Great question. This would fall under the A of my ABC’s of education, Advancing Academics. The role of books in a school system should be to enhance the learning of the subjects taught in the school. 
If there are  such books that are not enhancing subjects taught in school, I don’t think they need to be in there.
<p>Answering a little bit more specifically, when considering the removal of books from school libraries, I believe books that contain graphic content, hate speech, extreme violence, explicit sexual content, perpetuate misinformation or promote discrimination should not be in our schools. 
If need be, decisions about which books to remove should be a collaborative process including input from the teachers, librarians, school board and parents.
","I feel like this is a dangerous road to go down. If we are not informing parents of students’ decisions about their preferred pronouns and maybe questions about their identity, of what other aspects of their school life are we not informing parents? Is it OK not to inform parents of their student failing a class? When is it OK for the school to withhold information regarding their child and decisions affecting their child’s identity and well-being? This may lead to distrust of what else the school is keeping from parents and does not foster transparency and open communication. I believe parents have the absolute right to know what is going on with  their child socially, emotionally and academically. I believe it is absolutely essential to maintain open dialogue among schools, parents and students to foster understanding and support."

Our school system can greatly benefit from 4-H programs inside our schools, as other states do.","It is already a struggling program with counties that cannot budget the Blueprint in their school funding.  For starters, counties can't fund  the higher teacher salaries, so schools are already understaffed, including Talbot County schools. There is also a lack of teachers for the specialized programs for minority multi-language learners. It prioritizes equity and not education. No student learns the same way, and it should be based on each student’s individuality of learning and use of those strengths for learning and college/career readiness. Addressing minority needs would no longer be necessary if we stopped looking at them as “minorities” but individuals who are worthy of learning and have strengths that we are overlooking because they have to be “equal” to someone else, whoever that someone else may be?","I absolutely love this plan and think we definitely need to reduce and possibly remove cellphone usage in schools. It detracts from learning in a plethora of ways. We can allow students to have some time to use their cellphones in a controlled setting during the school day if necessary, i.e., lunchtime. This will help reduce cheating, interruptions with texting and calls, school bullying and possibly and hopefully school threats of violence. ","According to the multiple number of teachers I have spoken to, school safety is their main concern. They feel threatened by students and feel a lack of support from administration and the current board with handling of these threats.

<p>•        Student mastery of essential knowledge and skills
<p>•        Retention, recruitment and support of excellent teachers
<p>•        Positive, safe, effective, inclusive school climate for all learners
<p>•        Family and student engagement
<p>Although test scores are not always indicative of a student’s mastery of the subject matter, statewide and local assessments indicate that many of our Talbot County Public Schools students are not yet achieving grade level standards in essential subjects. One of the most significant indicators for student success is an effective teacher, and, like the rest of the nation, Talbot has faced significant teacher shortages. A positive, safe, effective and inclusive school climate is fundamental for student success, as well as teacher retention. Finding innovative ways to engage families, including non-English speakers, and students will support all aspects of student success. 
<p>The current board and superintendent are making progress toward addressing these issues despite many challenges, such as the learning gap caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through additional instructional support, expanding use of innovative community partnerships, strategic use of technology, targeted allocation of resources, and engaging all sectors of our community, I believe that working together we can accelerate progress in these areas.","When asked this question growing up, my answer was often the same: my dad. He grew up poor in a small town in Ohio; his dad had an eighth-grade education. He went into the Navy, went to college on the G.I. Bill, and completed his doctorate in education when I was 10. When we moved into a wonderful town with a crumbling high school, he led the campaign to promote funding and building a much-needed new school, with a courageous slogan of “Give A Damn, Vote Yes!"" He went on to be elected to the town council and mayor. This was in the ‘70s, and he saw equity and inclusion, treating all people with dignity and respect, and helping youth reach their highest potential as key to a successful community. These values were not about party or politics;  they were about building a strong, vibrant community where all can thrive. ","Talbot County Public Schools' current board, superintendent and team have a detailed plan for managing the Blueprint. I commend the transparency with which they are approaching this massive undertaking, providing regular reports on Blueprint progress for public review. There are areas of the Blueprint that Talbot was already tackling, and new areas that are now required to be addressed. Smaller districts such as Talbot may need to have different approaches from larger districts. There are many aspects of the Blueprint that are positive; however, some of the most challenging aspects of the Blueprint in Talbot are state mandates without sufficient funding. I would support continued efforts to address the state funding formula as it has been applied to Talbot County. ","Cellphones have become integral to modern life, offering quick communication and access to information. However, we have seen that excessive or unregulated use in school can disrupt learning, contribute to distraction, and even increase anxiety and bullying through social media. Cellphone policy enforcement, or a lack of enforceable policy, can be challenging and frustrating for teachers.  There are a variety of ways to manage cellphone use during the day in a way that minimizes use and distractions during instructional time. One method, the use of securing phones in individual pouches during the school day, has been used in other districts and will be piloted in one school in Talbot County this fall. By incorporating feedback from teachers, parents, and students, we can create policy that is enforceable and effective at reducing distractions, and promotes safety, student well-being and positive school culture.","Like many people, I am not satisfied with the safety of our students in the United States. Talbot County Public Schools has made strides in ensuring student safety by increasing and training school resource officers, and there is always room for improvement. We need to ensure that safety protocols are consistently reviewed and updated, and it is crucial that we prioritize both physical safety and emotional well-being. This includes expanding mental health resources, fostering a positive school climate, and providing ongoing training for staff and parents on recognizing and addressing safety concerns. In addition to preventing incidents, school safety is also about creating an environment where every student feels supported, respected, and secure in their school and in their ability to learn.","I believe in providing access to a wide range of books that inspire a love of reading and learning, foster critical thinking, and engage empathy and understanding of diverse perspectives. I welcome parental input and value our educators' expertise. I respect parents’ values and encourage them to guide their own children’s reading choices, rather than restricting access for all. I support a transparent review process for new curriculum, similar to the current Talbot County Public Schools system, which involves teachers, administrators and opportunity for community feedback. This ensures that materials are evaluated fairly, respecting diverse perspectives while maintaining a curriculum that fosters learning, critical thinking, and strong reading skills. ","<p>It is important to create a safe and supportive environment for all students, where they feel respected and acknowledged. And, I recognize the vital role that parents play in their children's lives and education. Open communication between schools and families is key to fostering trust and ensuring that all students' needs are met.
<p>There are a wide variety of circumstances to be considered, and any policies regarding pronoun use should prioritize both student safety and transparency with parents, while considering each student's unique circumstances. Our goal should be to create an inclusive school climate where all students can thrive."

I’d be remiss if I didn’t give a quick shoutout to the Birth-K/Early Intervention program and the therapist and teachers in that program; they have been wonderful and a huge part of my youngest son’s development.","I’m a good candidate for the school board because I have children in Washington County who will soon be school age and/or already use services through Washington County Public Schools. I grew up with a mom who was a public-school teacher (now a well-deserved retiree). I am fluent in Spanish and have lived abroad giving me a diverse perspective and respect for different cultures and ways of life. I have a career background in being fiscally responsible and focusing on continuous improvement. Finally, and most importantly, I am ready to fight for your kids and mine.  ","There are a lot of important issues facing the school board. The problem I continue to hear from parents, teachers and students from schools all over the county is the behavioral issues in classrooms. This problem has been brought up to the current board, with even potential solutions to be reviewed; however, unfortunately most of the current board stops the discussion and throws up their hands citing state laws that prevent solutions to this issue. I am a problem solver who doesn’t throw up my hands but rather tries every possible route to get to a solution (over, around, through, under, etc.). A recent student (who had just graduated) during a public forum brought up in almost every class, every year of his high school career, there was a student who would disrupt the classroom. This disruption prevented the rest of the class from learning. We must come up with a solution that will allow teachers to manage their classrooms, and if needed, remove disruptive students. Students do not repetitively disrupt classrooms without mental or emotional hardships or struggles or some other underlying factors. By leaving those students in the classroom, we are doing a disservice to not only the rest of the class who are eager to learn but also to the student who needs more devoted attention and help. ","A particular public leader doesn’t come to mind, but what comes to mind is characteristics of leaders that I admire. Characteristics that include thoughtfulness, the ability and willingness to listen and learn, negotiation skills, being able to communicate effectively and efficiently, and lastly but probably most important is unwavering values. One of my pet peeves is when leaders/politicians sacrifice values for votes. I’m a firm believer in term limits to help prevent this career-politician mentality that leads to decisions for votes.","The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future is presented in a way that would make it very difficult to have anything but positive support for it. Even how it is presented in this question, at face value I agree it because it is all important and needed things — increased funding for early childhood education, awesome! — increasing our hardworking teachers' pay, awesome! — expanding services to multilingual and impoverished families, awesome! — etc. However, when this passed it was presented as being fully funded for at least the first 10 years, which only three years later is proving to unfortunately not be the case. For example, the Kirwan Commission says this law will require at least 15,000 more teachers (statewide), which will be around an additional $900 million in just salaries (not including benefits). I’m not against additional teachers and additional resources for our kids, but I’m also pragmatic, and right now the state does not have a solution for the financial burden of this Blueprint. So, it is and will impact our county significantly as these laws (there are different steps to implement this plan) come into effect and we cannot fund them. ","In general, I think we are all plugged in too much. Adults and students are experiencing higher levels of anxiety, depression and poor sleep quality due to cellphone usage. With that in mind, I am for limitations and restrictions of cellphone usage. Before creating a policy, I would need to hear more from teachers and parents. I like to make holistic and thought-out decisions and would not be doing that if I came up with a policy on cellphone usage in a vacuum.","Our children, teachers and staff’s safety is the highest priority. If you read through the Washington County Public Schools Safety and Security Measures (wcpsmd.com/safety-security), it’s clear safety is a priority and we have a plan; but I do think we can continue to improve and add safety measures. I am in favor of having a resource officer in every school. We should also have closed-circuit TV in all schools and intrusion alarms (currently we have in many but not all schools). ","I believe there is a time and place for all things. I do not believe our school libraries are the right place (or time — especially since students’ junior year and below are minors) for books that include crude sexual content. At a public forum, a concerned grandma read from a book that is in our school’s libraries that contained crude sexual content. One parent grabbed their kid to leave, and other adults were visually uncomfortable. I’m not sure why any book like that is needed in our school libraries.",Any policy that intentionally deceives or does not inform parents about their child is a policy I do not support. The only exception to that would of course be a policy that deals with suspected abuse at home; that would be handed over to agencies that specialize in those terrible scenarios.

",I received an associate degree from Allegany College of Maryland for Dental Hygiene.,"I am a parent of two Washington County Public Schools students. I feel we are missing the voice and insight of a parent on the board, and I hope to be that voice. I believe our current school system is broken. I disagree with how we are handling disruptive and violent behaviors, the grading rubric, and feel we are teaching children things that shouldn't be taught in school, or not at the age-appropriate time. ","I believe my biggest strength is that I am an “outsider.” This means my judgment isn't tainted with the current status quo. I plan on being a problem-focused board member. I do not want to hear about all the things we are doing right. Instead, I want staff and the community to feel comfortable coming to me with problems and for us to collaborate with them to find solutions, if possible.","Behavior issues are the biggest issue facing our school board. This is the number one reason teachers are leaving the profession. It is also causing our children trauma while at school. I believe we should have a class in each school where students with behavior issues are taught. Each of these students will be part of the ABLE — Achieving a Better Life Experience — program, so that each child is being taught by a teacher for their grade. The classroom will be monitored by a board-certified behavior analyst specialist so they are able to handle behavioral issues as they arise. I also think a paraprofessional should be there for additional support. ","This is my first time ever running for office, and I am now seeing firsthand the amount of work that goes into running. I think there is something to admire about any public leader who is willing to step up and help their communities.","I believe the Blueprint has good intentions, and I do like some of the things within Blueprint. However, everything costs money. There is no possible way we are able to fund everything required by the Blueprint. The state has already not been able to give us all the funding it initially intended. Other counties are having the same issue when it comes to funding the Blueprint. I think we, as county boards and the state, need to prioritize what we feel is most important and remove some of the other requirements.
","I support our current cellphone policy and the steps our Washington County Public Schools are using to enforce the policy. I am OK with students being able to use cellphones at lunch or during emergencies. I believe during instruction time, cellphones should be put away.","School safety I believe is everyone's top priority. I think we should speak with our safety resource officers regularly to see if they spot any weaknesses with our current efforts. On a side note, I believe every school should have a LifeVac in every cafeteria in case of a choking incident. ","Yes, I do. I do not believe we should be distributing sexually explicit or pornographic library books to students. If parents are OK with their children reading these books, they can get them from the public library, or they can buy them. ","I completely disagree with this. Anytime an adult tells a minor it is OK to keep a secret from their parents, a red flag goes up for me. I find this to be predatory and grooming behavior. I, as a parent, am tired of the state feeling they have more ownership over our children than the parents. For those who agree with this, do you truly believe it benefits the children having a secret identity? I think there would be plenty of parents who would support their children, but we can't if we aren't aware. "
Washington County,Robin Merchant Spickler,y,null,null,robinmerchantspickler@gmail.com,70,Retired teacher.,"Master’s of education in early childhood education from Hood College, Frederick.","After spending my whole career in the teaching field, I felt the drive to give all stakeholders (students, teachers and communities) a voice. I want every student and teacher to be treated with dignity and respect. I want parents to know what the school board is trying to do to help with the education of their children and why the school board does certain things. Some of the decisions that are made may not be popular, but they are made in the best interest of all. I want the chance to work with the Washington County Public Schools superintendent, Dr. David Sovine, to continue to build on the many successes of his leadership and make improvements to our school system to be even better. ","As a retired elementary teacher of 44 years from the Washington County Public Schools system, I have experience and I understand how the Board of Education's policies and decisions impact students, teachers and the school communities. I am a life-long resident of Washington County, I am committed to providing representation and a voice for those who live throughout the county and for issues related to all stakeholders (students, teachers, and communities), to ensure that the needs and issues that affect all are heard and considered at the table. As a taxpayer, I am committed to fiscal responsibility but also committed to making the necessary investments in public education that are needed for our schools. ","Staff recruitment and retention is one of the most critical issues facing our school board. Teachers are leaving for higher pay and less stressful jobs. While salaries have increased, I would advocate for an increase in funding to see that they are in keeping with the areas around Washington County and that would make teaching an attractive profession for graduates to go into. I would like to see a real push on getting people to come back to teaching with a campaign that offers training and support to come back without the sacrifice of not earning enough money to make ends meet. The mental health and well-being of teachers are a concern because of the growing student behaviors. First, there needs to be an acknowledgment that there is a problem. Then all the stakeholders can work together and look for solutions. This could be addressing the workload, implementing flexible working, and continuing to allow teachers to work at home to complete lesson planning/report cards.","The one public leader that I admire would be Larry Hogan. Larry Hogan was faced with making so many tough decisions as our governor of Maryland during COVID, and he worked hard for all the citizens of Maryland during that time. He was not worried about what other states or fellow Republicans thought he should do; he wanted to keep his constituents safe. He was up-front and honest with everyone from day one. He showed strength and integrity, a trait of a great human being. ","The Blueprint for Maryland is most definitely a move in the right direction for the success of all stakeholders. The implementation of it is going to be a major issue, and with my experience, I can ensure that students and teachers get their needs met. Our Washington County Public School system has been increasing the early childhood education programs to where there are pre-kindergarten classes in every elementary school and in two high schools in the county. Increasing teacher starting salary has also been on the front burner, and it continues to be. Washington County Public School system, collaboratively with the Washington County Teacher Association, works to meet the requirements of the Blueprint for the starting salary of teachers. There is the need to have conversations to strengthen effective methods to recruit, hire, develop and retain staff. There is the Birth to Kindergarten Department and the Judy Center that provide families with academic and basic needs support. There is a program created for juniors and seniors to earn 60 credits as part of an accelerated Teacher Academy of Maryland program. There are telephonic and in-person interpretation and translation available. In the Washington County Public School system there are multilingual family liaison paraprofessionals and elementary multiliterate teacher family specialists to support families. There is a digital texting communication application and an English learner outreach engagement program. A community school coordinator has been established in several elementary schools.","The Washington County Public School system has implemented a new cellphone policy: “FOCUS NOW! PHONES LATER.” This has been a long time coming, it is in the best interest of the students’ well-being and their academic progress. It will help the students learn in a positive and productive environment. Excessive screen time and social media use is impacting the students, especially during the school day. During instructional time, the devices (cellphones, tablets, smart watches, earbuds) are to be kept out of sight and turned off. Students may be disciplined for using their cellphones, and a school administrator may take the cellphone.","Ensuring the safety of all students and teachers is important and the Washington County Public School system does not take this lightly. Over the last several years, safety vestibules have been built in all the schools in Washington County, and only personnel with Washington County Public School-issued badges are allowed access. The school system regularly practices and reviews safety procedures in all schools. Having metal detectors installed or school resource officers is another way to increase the safety of students and teachers. No matter what safety measures are in place … everyone needs to be vigilant. ","It is the parents’ choice. It is not in my place to advise a parent what their child should or should not read. There is a policy in place, in the Washington County Public School system, that a parent can view the books that are in their child’s Media Center. If there is a book that the parent does not want their child to have access to, the media teacher will flag it, and their child will not be able to access it. Their right to do that for their child will not restrict another child from choosing to read that book. If a parent has a concern about the nature or language of a book, they can fill out paperwork, and it will be sent to a committee to review.","This is truly a very controversial topic and one that should not be taken lightly. I am not sure that an elementary student would understand the meaning behind using other pronouns than he/she, him/her, or other ones. Now an older student coming of age may very well understand and begin to test the waters as to where they fit in. There should be a support plan developed for students to ensure they feel comfortable expressing their gender identity. A policy like this is not trying to undermine parental rights, it is trying to create an environment where the student feels safe, trusted and trusting so that they have the best opportunity to learn. We want students to be able to talk with their teachers or counselors about things that may be problematic for them at home."

On a personal level, my grandchildren attend Washington County Public Schools.","As an incumbent and a former teacher and administrator for Washington County Public Schools, I am committed to our students, teachers, staff and parents. I also have experience as a CEO of an electronics company and small airline, and served our community as a registered nurse. I love to learn and want to foster that joy in our students. As chairperson of the Curriculum and Instruction Committee, I have had the pleasure to advance our Career and Technical Education and Apprenticeship Program.",School safety is the top priority. We will continue to address this through an expanded school resource officer and safety officers in each school as we curb bullying and address mental health issues. A student must feel safe to learn and feel a part of our school system. Having 119 dual completers from building an airplane to Middle College offers options and also meets the needs of students  to function in a cohort and be prepared for life after high school.,"Washington County Commissioner Colonel Derek Harvey (retired) worked tirelessly to defend our country in Iraq and Afghanistan. When he returned to the United States, he became a presidential intelligence adviser on the China and Russia Desk. He moved to Washington County and was elected to serve us with the same wisdom and zeal and continues to work for every citizen. I asked him if he would return to Washington. His answer was classic and selfless: I have more to offer the citizens of this county. He still works tirelessly, is well researched on all topics, asks the hard questions, and does not back down from doing the next right thing.","Fortunately, we were already in compliance with most of the Blueprint mandates including universal pre-kindergarten, college and career readiness, school safety, support for multilingual and free and reduced-price meal students, and teacher salaries-including support and a stipend for national board certified teachers, prior to its passage. We have led the state in these goals. However, promised funding is drying up at the state level and the county level. Going forward, we will be challenged to continue to fund an unfunded mandate. ","This year, I championed the enforcement of our policy: no cellphones during instruction. Each student has a school issued Chromebook for use in classes, so cellphones are not needed for instruction. Cellphones have become a distraction and in some cases an addiction, as well as a means to organize inappropriate behaviors. It is a safety measure.","School safety is a priority, as well as a work in progress. We have built kiosks that require an ID to enter the building, staffed schools with school resource officers and additional security officers, built fences, and educated our school community.","Parental partnerships foster student success. We have in place a policy that allows parents to challenge the inclusion of any books in our libraries. Books that would rob students of their innocence, introducing mature topics, should not be available without parental awareness in schools. We have a robust public library system where all books can be accessed.",Parents must always be a part of the student's team. Their input is essential.

","My passion is to make sure that the next generation of young people is better than my generation and equipped to succeed in a world that we can only imagine. The success of our democracy is directly dependent upon the quality of public schools. Public schools are the economic engine of our community and state. Strong public schools provide an equitable opportunity for each student to excel in school and in life. By using my energy and experience, I am committed to helping our school system make a lasting difference in the students that we serve. ","A great candidate for the Board of Education is a person who deeply cares about the community and truly understands the potential impact that a high quality public education can make on the lives of our young people. A great candidate is a person who matriculated through public schools and has experience in working as a professional or volunteer in public schools. A great candidate believes, embraces and values the contributions of each member of our public school family. ","Public school systems are a people business. For our school system to be successful, we need the best and most talented people working in our school system. The most important issue facing our school system is the ability to hire and retain the best teachers, leaders and support staff. With a systemic teacher shortage, hiring and retaining staff to work in a rural community presents constant challenges. The quality of a public school system is the people. The people make the difference. The challenge is recruiting and hiring the best people. ","The public leader that I admire the most is my father. My father was a Methodist minister who served rural churches in Pennsylvania. Regardless of the assignment, he worked tirelessly to make a difference in each community. From church suppers to providing counseling to Sunday service, he gave his all to raise people up and address their needs. ","I fully support the Blueprint pillars. However, without additional state funding, we will not be able to implement the Blueprint plan without making significant budget cuts to reallocate funds. As an example, to reach the $60,000 minimum salary, we will need to significantly increase class size and reduce materials of instruction. Due to the state funding formula, our school system will only receive an additional $4.33 per student per day in additional state aid to implement the nation’s most comprehensive public school enhancement plan. To implement the Blueprint, we will need additional state aid. In addition, instead of using the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP),  the state needs to use a different tool to measure student success. NAEP was never intended to provide a means to measure improvement over time. ","Cellphones are both a needed form of communication and a classroom distraction. Currently, in our school system, each school creates a school-based policy on cellphone use. I support bringing together a workgroup of students, parents, and educators to study the topic and make a recommendation for a school system policy. ","Our most important duty is to ensure the safety of our students, staff, and visitors. Our school system was one of the first in the state to have school resource officers. We work closely with our Sheriff's Office through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to maintain safe schools. We need to continue to refine the MOU and provide structural changes to our school buildings and increase the use of technology (campus cameras, door alarms, etc...). We need to continue work with our law enforcement partners, enhance our summer safe schools retreat, and strengthen our proactive approach to preventing problems.  ","We need to assure that we have appropriate procedures in place to select the right library books and resources to support our curriculum. Once books become a part of the collection, then parents need to have online access to the library book catalog, are invited to review the collection, and allowed to restrict access to any book(s) that their child should not be able to have access. Parents must be given full control over which book(s) their child can borrow from the school library. ","Parents must be invited, engaged and involved in all aspects of public education. When a child seeks to use their preferred nonconforming pronouns, then the parents must be informed, and a parent conference held. The parents must determine which pronouns to be used and the school must follow the parental decision. "

",,"I have been an educator all of my life, and several people asked me to run to help our board become more focused on our children. I feel I can do that well, so I agreed to run. I am excited to work with Worcester County schools and move us forward. ","Over 40 years in education as teacher, administrator and running my own educational consulting service. I am a conservative, common-sense candidate, which appears to be badly needed. I love my county and want our children to have the best education they can possibly have. ","We have great students, but our achievement is mediocre. I would hope to move the board toward providing more staff development for teachers on instructional strategies and more work with administrators on being in schools and classrooms more. As a board member, I would want to also be in the schools regularly, so I know what is happening first-hand. After observing, I would hope there would be a discussion on how we can improve achievement and a plan to do so. ","I admire Katie Addis, school board member in Worcester, because she has worked so hard to bring conservative common-sense actions to the board and has stood alone on so many issues but kept on fighting for what was best for our children regarding safety, education, morality, budget, etc. She comes prepared to every meeting, unlike others, and she has never given up fighting for our schools, our teachers and especially our children. ","The goals are admirable. It is what successful schools should do and what many schools are doing. I think it could be simplified and more cost effective, however. ","Cellphones have become a real distraction for student learning. I believe in limiting their use during class time. However, exactly how this should work should be a decision involving teachers and parents as well as the school board. If we want learning to improve, we must do something about cellphones during class. ",We need to have more consistent student consequences for all students as a result of similar behaviors.  We also need to work better with our local support services such as our sheriff’s office and our school safety officers. ,"If books are not age-appropriate, they should not be in that grade level’s library. This should be decided by a committee of a cross-section of the community, including parents. Inappropriate, sexually explicit books have no reason to be in libraries. Books should be connected to the curriculum and instruction of the students and support what is being taught. ",Parents should be informed about all aspects of their child’s school activities.

","I have served on our school board for seven years and have watched our district make great strides in academic excellence (#1 in math, #2 in literacy) as well as instituting proven safety protocols including a resource officer in every school. With our updated Memorandum of Understanding put in place in September 2023, we have had a 28% decrease in incidences and been recognized by state agencies. I'm looking forward to being able to oversee our continuing success.","I'm a retired educator with 25 years as a high school biology teacher/science department chair and five years at California State University Long Beach as an instructor, student teacher supervisor and the Toyota Elementary Education Coordinator. I've been privileged to experience working in education on many levels.","Finances and funding! With the state funding formula only providing less than 20%, our county bears 80% of our education budget despite a 53% poverty rate. We have spoken in front of the Kirwan Commission, Accountability and Implementation Board and the State Board of Education and aired our concerns. As our county tightens its belt, we are working to supplement some of our reduced funding through grant writing.","Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  I may not agree with him on all the issues, but his tenacity against overwhelming opposition has been admirable. And his focus on food additives and agricultural practices is definitely an important issue.","There are some great ideas but absolutely no funding. For example, we all want our amazing teachers to be fairly compensated, but to mandate by law a starting salary of $60,000 with no state financial help is insane. Other counties have also expressed the same concerns. Hopefully they can slow down the mandate deadlines or provide more state monies.","Personally, as a teacher, I think cellphone bans would be helpful, but we do an extensive parent survey every year, and overwhelmingly, our parents are against cellphone bans, so we have devised protocols for different grade levels from placing phones in their lockers or book bags to individual teachers collecting phones on their desk before class starts. Obviously teaching students responsible use is paramount, but it will be an ongoing challenge.","Entrance into our schools are monitored by cameras with locked doors and a buzz-in system. During my time on the school board, we have also been able to place a resource officer in every school. Working with our officers, we were able to institute an updated Memorandum of Understanding in September 2023, which has resulted in a 28% drop in incidences this year. We have been recognized by various state agencies and groups for our success. However, our work is never done. Our District Safety Committee, comprised of parents, educators and safety personnel, is meeting regularly to look into other safety protocols.","I oppose pornography in our school libraries. I have parents very concerned about this but also have parents who see the overall merits of certain books despite some passages. Instead of banning books, I was in favor of setting up a young adult section in our high school libraries, but the Freedom to Read Act has made that difficult. Thankfully we have had a parental opt-out process in place for a number of years. Any parent can go into our system and block their child from checking out specific books.  ","In education, I have always viewed our role as being in a partnership with our parents. Parents are the guardians of their minor children and should in no way be left out of major decisions such as this.  Working hand in hand with parents to help our students should be our goal."
